Function The lacrimal gland produces the aqueous layer of the eye's tear film. The aqueous layer of tears is made up of water, proteins, vitamins, electrolytes, and other substances. All these help lubricate the eye, wash away debris, and promote overall eye health. Tears from the lacrimal gland get to the eye via tiny openings. The lacrimal system provides the ocular surface with the necessary fluid for lubrication, both for optimising the optical properties of the precorneal tear film and protecting the eye from foreign bodies, viral and microbial infection. A sophisticated system balances... Tear film composition: The lacrimal gland contributes to the formation of the tear film, which consists of three layers: the inner mucin layer, middle aqueous layer, and outer lipid layer. For the lipid layer, the blink itself regulates release of presecreted meibomian gland lipids stored in the meibomian gland duct.

Eye movements were also implicated in visual direction (see Ono, 1979; Ono & Mapp, 1995 ). Example - For levoversion, equal and simultaneous innervation is received by the left lateral rectus and right medial rectus. An exception to this law is dissociated vertical or horizontal deviation. The dissociated horizontal nystagmus in the non-affected abducting eye can be explained by Hering's law of equal innervation, whereby in this case, the 'weak' medial rectus prompts the cortex to increase innervation to it 1,6. 6.2 History Extraocular muscle movement is described by two eponymous laws: Hering's law of equal innervation and Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation.

The fovea is a part of the ... During smooth-pursuit eye movements, the eye stays focused on an object in motion. Visual tracking skills can improve through visual tracking exercises.

      "Summary::\n",
      "The cornea needs to be transparent to visible light and precisely curved to provide the correct refractive power. Both properties are governed by its structure. Corneal transparency arises from constructive interference of visible light due to the relatively ordered arrangement of collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma. The arrangement is controlled by the negatively charged proteoglycans surrounding the fibrils. Small changes in fibril organisation can be tolerated but larger changes cause light scattering. Corneal keratocytes do not scatter light because their refractive index matches that of the surrounding matrix. When activated, however, they become fibroblasts that have a lower refractive index. Modelling shows that this change in refractive index significantly increases light scatter. At the microscopic level, the corneal stroma has a lamellar structure, the parallel collagen fibrils within each lamella making a large angle with those of adjacent lamellae. X-ray scattering has shown that the lamellae have preferred orientations in the human cornea: inferior-superior and nasal-temporal in the central cornea and circumferential at the limbus. The directions at the centre of the cornea may help withstand the pull of the extraocular muscles whereas the pseudo-circular arrangement at the limbus supports the change in curvature between the cornea and sclera. Elastic fibres are also present; in the limbus they contain fibrillin microfibrils surrounding an elastin core, whereas at the centre of the cornea, they exist as thin bundles of fibrillin-rich microfibrils. We present a model based on the structure described above that may explain how the cornea withstands repeated pressure changes due to the ocular pulse.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "The corneal endothelium comprises a monolayer of hexagonal cells and it is imperative to assess the health of the corneal endothelium. Specular microscopy is a noninvasive modality that can document the healthy and diseased endothelium photographically. Specular microscopy is also crucial in assessing the preoperative endothelial health before high-risk surgeries, comparing various techniques, the impact of lasers during refractive surgery, and the assessment of donor cornea before transplantation. Specular microscopy represents a transformative advancement in ophthalmic imaging, providing an unparalleled window into the corneal endothelium, a critical layer of cells vital for maintaining corneal transparency and overall ocular health. This noninvasive photographic technique allows clinicians and researchers to observe and assess the endothelial cell layer at the back of the cornea directly, offering insights that were once inaccessible without invasive methods or post-mortem analysis. The various endothelial pathologies where specular microscopy plays an important role include Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, corneal dystrophies, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, viral endothelitis, ICE syndrome, trauma, uveitis and pharmacological disruption of the endothelium. Various specular microscopes are available for documenting endothelial cell details at various magnifications and calibrations. Approximately 75 years ago, Vogt tried to obtain the endothelial cell morphology by using the reflected light of a slit lamp. However, limited magnification and rapid eye movements precluded a clear image. David Maurice first described specular microscopy in 1968. In 1975, Laing first used the specular microscope for clinical use\u001b[0m\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mCorneal transparency arises from constructive interference of visible light due to the relatively ordered arrangement of collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma. The alignment of collagen fibrils also contributes to corneal transparency, creating a pseudo-crystalline structure that facilitates the transmission of light through the cornea [ 46, 47 ]. The fibrils were well ordered and maintained the short-range order and the number of nearest-neighbor fibrils, although the averaged distance between them increased. Our results demonstrated that the cell therapy of rCF from ReLEx SMILe lenticules promotes the recovery of transparent corneal stroma after injury. Collagen fibril density, which decreased by approximately the same proportion as the fibril diameters increased in the periphery, suggests that the average spacing between the fibrils is relatively conserved throughout the cornea, perhaps in the interest of maintaining corneal transparency [ The cornea comprises a dense network of collagen fibrils dispersed in a hydrated matrix.

The corneal endothelium can be thought of as having both \"barrier\" and \"pump\" functions, and functions to counteract the passive leakage of aqueous humor through tight junctions into the stroma. This process is essential for maintaining corneal transparency and requires cellular energy to maintain. [3,5,6] Figure 1. Greater pleomorphism and polymegethism of the endothelial cells was observed in healthy patients with wider mean anterior chamber angle. This has left the researchers to worry that deepening of the anterior chamber as myopia progresses could render the corneal endothelium more fragile and susceptible to mechanical stress.

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are messenger pigeons of the cells that communicate about cellular microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated the expression of C8α and calpain-2 in EVs from vitreous of patients with bacterial endophthalmitis to assess its utility as a diagnostic marker.\n",
      "METHODS: EVs were isolated from vitreous of patients with bacterial endophthalmitis (culture positive and culture negative) and noninfectious control by exosome isolation reagent and characterized, and the levels of C8α and calpain-2 was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in isolated EVs and direct vitreous. The receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the diagnostic performance.\n",
      "RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) confirmed the presence of EVs having a diameter (nm) of 275.2 ± 93, 92 ± 22, and 77.28 ± 12 in culture-positive (CP), culture-negative (CN), and control respectively. The expression level (ng/mL) of C8α in the EVs obtained from CP was 144 ± 22 and CN was 31.2 ± 9.8, which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than control 3.7 ± 2.4. Interestingly, C8α is not expressed directly in the vitreous of CN and controls. Calpain-2 was significantly downregulated (P ≤ 0.0001) in CP (0.94 ± 0.16) and CN (0.70 ± 0.14) than control. The sensitivity and specificity of 1 for C8α and calpain-2 in the EVs implied that its diagnostic accuracy was significant.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the EV proteins C8α and calpain-2 could be suitable diagnostic markers for endophthalmitis. However, the presence of C8α in the EVs of CN samples but not in direct vitreous promises EVs as the future of diagnostics.\n",
      "TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Expression levels of EV-calpain-2 and EV-C8α could diagnose CN bacterial endophthalmitis.\n",

However, as organisms age, alterations occur within muscle tissue. These changes include sarcopenia, loss of neuromuscular junctions, and changes in mineral concentration, all of which have implications for calcium's role. Ionized calcium plays an important function in muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle function is governed by an action potential that releases calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium then binds to tropomyosin and allows for the interaction of myosin and actin in the sarcomere, leading to muscle contraction. Calcium is a prominent molecule in the body involved in many biochemical processes.

      "PURPOSE: To increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy, analyses by quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF) and near-infrared fundus autofluorescence (NIR-AF) were compared to results obtained by recommended screening tests.\n",
      "METHODS: Thirty-one patients (28 females, 3 males) were evaluated with standard automated perimetry and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); 28 also had multifocal electroretinography (mfERG). Measurement of short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW-AF) by qAF involved the use of an internal fluorescent reference and intensity measurements in eight concentric segments at 7° to 9° eccentricity. For semiquantitative analysis of NIR-AF, intensities were acquired along a vertical axis through the fovea.\n",
      "RESULTS: Four of 15 high-dose (total dose >1000 g, daily dose >5.0 mg/kg) patients and one of 16 low-dose (total dose <1000 g, daily dose 4.4 mg/kg) patients were diagnosed with HCQ-associated retinopathy based on abnormal 10-2 visual fields, SD-OCT, and SW-AF imaging. Three of the high-dose patients also had abnormal mfERG results. Of the five patients exhibiting retinopathy, two had qAF color-coded images revealing higher intensities inferior, nasal, and lateral to the fovea. The abnormal visual fields also exhibited superior-inferior differences. Mean NIR-AF gray-level intensities were increased in four high-dose patients with no evidence of retinopathy. In two patients with retinopathy, NIR-AF intensity within the parafovea was below the normal range. One high-dose patient (6.25 mg/kg) had only abnormal mfERG results.\n",

Single-cell RNA sequencing is being used to characterize choroidal cell types transcriptionally and discover their altered patterns of gene expression in aging and disease. The choroid is vulnerable to changes in blood flow that can result in thickness variations. Consequently, a reduction in blood flow might lead to choroidal hypoxia and thinning, which cause axial elongation. Nonetheless, the correlation between ChBF and ChT in myopia is complex and requires further investigation. Choroidal structure plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the eye and its function. In healthy eyes, the choroidal structure is characterized by a specific thickness and vascular network. Photodynamic therapy can lead to changes in the choroidal structure, including thinning and alterations in blood flow.

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The significant role of embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (eCSF) in the initial stages of brain development has been thoroughly studied. This fluid contains crucial molecules for proper brain development such as members of the Wnt and FGF families, apolipoproteins, and retinol binding protein. Nevertheless, the source of these molecules remains uncertain since they are present before the formation of the choroid plexus, which is conventionally known as the primary producer of cerebrospinal fluid. The subcommissural organ (SCO) is a highly conserved gland located in the diencephalon and is one of the earliest differentiating brain structures. The SCO secretes molecules into the eCSF, prior to the differentiation of the choroid plexus, playing a pivotal role in the homeostasis and dynamics of this fluid. One of the key molecules secreted by the SCO is SCO-spondin, a protein involved in maintenance of the normal ventricle size, straight spinal axis, neurogenesis, and axonal guidance. Furthermore, SCO secretes transthyretin and basic fibroblast growth factor 2, while other identified molecules in the eCSF could potentially be secreted by the SCO. Additionally, various transcription factors have been identified in the SCO. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the early SCO development are not fully understood.\n",
      "RESULTS: To uncover key molecular players and signaling pathways involved in the role of the SCO during brain development, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis comparing the embryonic chick SCO at HH23 and HH30 stages (4 and 7 days respectively). Additionally, a public transcriptomic data from HH30 entire chick brain was used to compare expression levels between SCO and whole brain transcriptome.

      "The development of the cornea is a fascinating process. Its dual origin involves the differentiation of surface ectoderm cells and the migration of mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin. This research aimed to demonstrate the morphogenesis of the rabbit cornea from fetal to postnatal life using light- and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. There were 27 rabbit embryos and nine rabbits used. The rabbit cornea begins its prenatal development on the twelfth day of gestation. The surface ectoderm differentiates into the corneal epithelium on day 13. Intriguingly, telocytes were visible within the epithelium. The secondary stroma develops on the sixteenth day of gestation by differentiation of keratocytes. At the age of 2 weeks, the lamellae of collagenous fibers become highly organized, and the stroma becomes avascular, indicating that the cornea has become transparent. Bowman's membrane appears on day 23 of pregnancy and disappears on day 30. The Descemet's membrane appears at this time and continues to thicken postnatally. The corneal endothelium appears on the twentieth gestational day as double layer of flattened cells and becomes a single layer of cuboidal cells on day 30. The spaces between the endothelial cells resemble craters. VEGF immunohistochemical expression increases over the course of development, reaching its peak in the first week after birth before decreasing in all corneal layers and becoming negative in the stroma. In conclusion, numerous morphogenetic events contribute to corneal maturation and transparency, allowing the cornea to perform its vital functions.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "The development of the cornea is a fascinating process. Its dual origin involves the differentiation of surface ectoderm cells and the migration of mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin. This research aimed to demonstrate the morphogenesis of the rabbit cornea from fetal to postnatal life using light- and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. There were 27 rabbit embryos and nine rabbits used. The rabbit cornea begins its prenatal development on the twelfth day of gestation. The surface ectoderm differentiates into the corneal epithelium on day 13. Intriguingly, telocytes were visible within the epithelium. The secondary stroma develops on the sixteenth day of gestation by differentiation of keratocytes. At the age of 2 weeks, the lamellae of collagenous fibers become highly organized, and the stroma becomes avascular, indicating that the cornea has become transparent. Bowman's membrane appears on day 23 of pregnancy and disappears on day 30. The Descemet's membrane appears at this time and continues to thicken postnatally. The corneal endothelium appears on the twentieth gestational day as double layer of flattened cells and becomes a single layer of cuboidal cells on day 30. The spaces between the endothelial cells resemble craters. VEGF immunohistochemical expression increases over the course of development, reaching its peak in the first week after birth before decreasing in all corneal layers and becoming negative in the stroma. In conclusion, numerous morphogenetic events contribute to corneal maturation and transparency, allowing the cornea to perform its vital functions.\n",

This tool calculates the spherical equivalent (SE) of a lens prescription, providing a single value that represents the combined effect of the sphere and cylinder powers of the lens.

It means that the lens bends the rays of light more sharply, indicating that it has greater optical power. For example, a lens with a focal length of 0.5 meters has a diopter power of 2, since 1 divided by 0.5 is 2. These equations, called the thin-lens equation and the lens maker's equation, allow us to quantitatively analyze thin lenses. Consider the thick bi-convex lens shown in Figure 2.5.8. The index of refraction of the surrounding medium is n 1 (if the lens is in air, then n1 = 1.00) and that of the lens is n2.

The characteristics of an image formed by a flat mirror are: (a) The image and object are the same distance from the mirror, (b) The image is a virtual image, and (c) The image is situated behind the mirror. Image length is half the radius of curvature. f = R 2 f = R 2. The distance at which the image blurs, and beyond which it inverts, is the focal length of the lens.

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mIs there a way to find the object and image distances from the object height, image height, and focal length? I understand that the magnification is equal to −di do − d i d o or hi ho h i h o, but how does that relate to the mirror equation, 1 f = 1 di + 1 do 1 f = 1 d i + 1 d o? optics visible-light reflection geometric-optics Share Cite Explanation Calculation Example: The lens equation is a fundamental equation in geometrical optics that relates the focal length of a lens to the object distance and image distance. It is given by the formula: 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i, where f is the focal length, d_o is the object distance, and d_i is the image distance. The formula used for the Converging Lens Calculator is: 1 / f = 1 / do + 1 / di . This formula reveals the inverse relationship between the focal length, object distance, and image distance. By inputting values for either the object distance and image distance, or the focal length, you can easily determine the missing parameter. We can see the sign convention in both Lens. Some points to note. Focal length of Convex Lens is positive. Focal length of Concave Lens is negative. Since object is always in front of the lens, object distance is always negative. If a real image is formed, image is formed on right side, so image distance is positive. For a Convex Lens, object can be kept at different positionsHence, we take different casesCase 1 - Object is Placed at infinityIn this Case, Object is kept far away from lens (almost at infinite distance)So, we draw rays parallel to principal axisSince ray parallel to principal axis passes through t\u001b[0m\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mThe image distance d i is defined to be the distance of the image from the center of a lens. The height of the object and the height of the image are indicated by h o and h i, respectively. The distance of the image from the center of the lens is called image distance. An image that is on the same side of the lens as the object and cannot be projected on a screen is called a virtual image. Explanation Calculation Example: The lens equation is a fundamental equation in geometrical optics that relates the focal length of a lens to the object distance and image distance. It is given by the formula: 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i, where f is the focal length, d_o is the object distance, and d_i is the image distance. The Thin Lens Equation Calculator serves as a handy tool in the field of optics, aiding in determining critical parameters such as the focal length, object distance, and image distance. Through a simple input of values into the calculator, users can swiftly obtain precise optical measurements necessary for various applications. For this example, the object is found at 50ft from the center of the lens. Next, determine the distance from the center of the lens to the projected image on the opposite side of the lens. For this problem, the projected image is found to be at 45 ft from the lens. Finally, using the formula 1/do + 1/di = 1/f, calculate the focal length.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mSo incident light polarized parallel to the chains is absorbed by the sheet; light polarized perpendicularly to the chains is transmitted. The durability and practicality of Polaroid makes it the most common type of polarizer in use, for example for sunglasses, photographic filters, and liquid crystal displays. Blocking vertically polarized light: The Polaroid filter only allows light waves that are oscillating along its transmission axis to pass through. Since the transmission axis is aligned horizontally, vertically polarized light will be blocked as it is perpendicular to the transmission axis. 2. For a lens, the direction of light going into the camera is going to be nearly perpendicular to the lens surfaces. To achieve the desired interference, the coating layer thicknesses have to be certain values. Then, for a modern camera lens, the light reflected out of the coating will be very neutral in color, that is to say nearly white. When such light is passed through a polaroid, half the light gets through. To see why this should be so, break every electric field vector of every wave into components parallel and perpendicular to the polarizing axis.

Several devices have been developed to evaluate corneal biomechanics; however, each has advantages and limitations. 3.1. Ocular Response Analyzer. For example, the maximum deformation amplitude (DA Max) is the displacement of the corneal apex in the anterior-posterior plane. In contrast, the maximum deflection amplitude (DeflAmpMax) is the DA Max minus WEM [ 26, 32 ]. The DA ratios 1 or 2 mm are the DA Max divided by the DA at 1 or 2 mm away from the apex. The formula used in Diopter calculation is straightforward and is as follows: Diopter (D) = 1 / F. Where: Diopter (D) represents the lens's diopter strength. F signifies the focal length of the lens in meters (m). The inverse relationship between the focal length and diopter strength is the fundamental principle behind this calculation. The new focal length is equivalent to 63.1 diopters.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a drug given through a vein to help break up a blood clot so that blood flow can return to normal. It is used for the emergency treatment of ischemic stroke, which occurs when a blood clot interrupts blood flow to a region of the brain. The timely administration of tPA can save lives. Because of this selectivity for plasminogen activation, tPA is more widely used clinically. 7 PAI-1, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene family, is a major physiologic inhibitor of tPA and uPA at the level of plasminogen activation, thereby inhibiting the plasminogen-to-plasmin conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. 8, 9 α 2 ...

      "Stroke affects up to one in five people during their lifetime in some high-income countries, and up to almost one in two in low-income countries. Globally, it is the second leading cause of death. Clinically, the disease is characterised by sudden neurological deficits. Vascular aetiologies contribute to the most common causes of ischaemic stroke, including large artery disease, cardioembolism, and small vessel disease. Small vessel disease is also the most frequent cause of intracerebral haemorrhage, followed by macrovascular causes. For acute ischaemic stroke, multimodal CT or MRI reveal infarct core, ischaemic penumbra, and site of vascular occlusion. For intracerebral haemorrhage, neuroimaging identifies early radiological markers of haematoma expansion and probable underlying cause. For intravenous thrombolysis in ischaemic stroke, tenecteplase is now a safe and effective alternative to alteplase. In patients with strokes caused by large vessel occlusion, the indications for endovascular thrombectomy have been extended to include larger core infarcts and basilar artery occlusion, and the treatment time window has increased to up to 24 h from stro\u001b[0m\n",

      ": To compare the efficacy and safety of trabeculectomy with a collagen matrix implant (Ologen) versus trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) versus trabeculectomy with both Ologen and MMC (OLO + MMC).  This non-randomized study included 119 eyes of 101 patients with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma who underwent trabeculectomy, either alone or combined with phacoemulsification. The data were initially recorded following a standard surgical protocol, using an electronic database with structured fields. The patients were divided into three groups: 44 received trabeculectomy with adjunctive MMC (MMC group), 34 received surgery with Ologen (OLO group), and 41 received surgery with both Ologen and MMC (OLO + MMC group). The main outcome measures were the change in intraocular pressure (IOP), change in number of medications needed, complete success rate (defined as IOP ≤ 20 mmHg and at least 20% IOP reduction without hypotensive medications), rate of complications, and rate of postoperative interventions. The follow-up period was 36 months. : IOPs significantly decreased ( = 0.01) in all groups across all study visits, decreasing from 19.8 ± 4.6 mmHg to 12.7 ± 4.2 mmHg in the MMC group, from 20.5 ± 4.7 mmHg to 13.9 ± 3.5 mmHg in the OLO group, and from 23.5 ± 6.1 mmHg to 13.1 ± 3.5 mmHg in the OLO + MMC group. After correcting for the baseline IOP, only the first two postoperative visits (first week and first month) showed a significantly greater IOP reduction in the OLO + MMC group. The number of hypotensive medications was significantly reduced from 3.1 ± 0.6 to 0.56 ± 1.1 in the MMC group, from 2.9 ± 0.4 to 0.83 ± 1.1 in the OLO group, and from 3.0 ± 0.6 to 0.45 ± 0.95 in OLO + MMC group, with no stat\u001b[0m\n",

      "The level of cytokine expression was measured in human coronary artery (HCAEC) and internal thoracic artery (HITAEC) endothelial cells exposed to 500 ng/ml alkylating mutagen mitomycin C (MMC) and 5 μM atorvastatin. It was found that treatment of MMC-exposed HCAEC with atorvastatin decreased secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL-8, and IL8 gene expression, but increased the expression of SERPINE1 gene encoding the PAI-1 protein. In atorvastatin-treated HITAEC, the concentration of MIF protein and the expression of the IL8 and SERPINE1 genes were reduced. We can conclude that atorvastatin prevents proinflammatory activation of endothelial cells cultured under conditions of genotoxic load. However, the molecular mechanisms of this effect require further research.\n",

      "The discovery of antivascular endothelial growth factor medications has resulted in a substantial change in diabetic retinopathy treatment. The most common cause of diabetic retinopathy blindness is Diabetic Macular Edema. The pathophysiology of Diabetic Macular Edema is thought to include the well-known pro-angiogenic and pro-permeability factor vascular endothelial growth factor. Over the past decade, drugs that impede the functions of vascular endothelial growth factors have established themselves as a standard-of-care treatment for a range of ocular ailments and improved patients' clinical results with diabetic retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema, and their frequency has grown exponentially with the introduction of these agents Pegaptanib, Ranibizumab, and Aflibercept which are approved for ophthalmic indications, while Bevacizumab is used off-label. These medications delivered intravitreally have halted the vascular development of diabetic retinopathy.

      "RESULTS: A total of 12 samples were analyzed. The proteomics results showed that a total of 58 proteins were identified as DEPs, of which 47 proteins were up-regulated and 11 proteins were down-regulated. We found that C1q and tumor necrosis factor related protein 5 (C1QTNF5), Clusterin (CLU), tissue inhibitor of metal protease 1 (TIMP1) and signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) can all be specifically regulated after aflibercept treatment. GO functional analysis showed that some DEPs are related to changes in inflammatory regulatory pathways caused by PDR.

      "Dysplastic lesions and epithelial neoplasms of the conjunctiva account for approximately 2% of all malignant tumors in subtropical Tanzania. We examined the pathophysiologic role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of conjunctival carcinoma in subtropical Tanzania, which has a high HPV prevalence. Tissue samples from 14 patients were obtained from the cancer registry archives at the medical center of the university in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A highly sensitive nonradioactive in situ hybridization technique (ImmunoMax) was applied to paraffin-embedded tissue samples to identify HPV DNA in conjunctival epithelial dysplasia and epithelial neoplasms. In each case, conventional morphologic evaluation revealed a transitional lesion extending from koilocytic dysplasia to severe dysplasia or invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Highly specific, morphologically easily distinguishable labeling of HPV-6/11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 was found in most cases. Coinfections were observed frequently. The signals showed varying intensities and different patterns of distribution. In general, higher signal intensity was found in dysplasia grades 1 and 2 and in well-differentiated areas of the invasive component of conjunctival carcinoma compared with less differentiated areas. This observation underlines the central role of HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the oncogenesis of conjunctival cancers in subtropical Tanzania.\u001b[0m\n",

We hypothesized that goblet cell deficient dysplasia and serrated dysplasia may be the primary precursor lesions for goblet cell deficient (GCDAC) and serrated (SAC) variants of colonic adenocarcinoma, respectively. Clinicopathologic features of 23 GCDAC and 10 SAC colectomy cases were analyzed. All dysplastic lesions found adjacent to the colorectal cancers (n = 22 for GCDACs and n = 10 for SACs) were subtyped as conventional, nonconventional, or mixed-type dysplasia. As controls, 12 IBD colectomy cases with well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that lacked any mucinous, signet ring cell, low-grade tubuloglandular, or serrated features while retaining goblet cells throughout the tumor (at least 50% of the tumor) were evaluated. The cohort consisted of 19 (58%) men and 14 (42%) women, with a mean age of 53 years and a long history of IBD (mean duration: 18 y). Twenty-seven (82%) patients had ulcerative colitis. GCDACs (57%) were more often flat or invisible than SACs (10%) and controls (25%; P = 0.023).

The Axenfeld Nerve Loop is a unique anatomical variation in which the long ciliary nerve, a branch of the nasociliary nerve, forms a loop around the optic nerve head before continuing on to innervate the anterior segment of the eye. This looping occurs within the sclera and can be observed during eye examinations. These receptors transmit a signal through the short and long ciliary nerves to a division of the ophthalmic trigeminal nerve, the ciliary ganglion, and subsequently to the Gasser ganglion. Once the signal reaches the trigeminal ganglion, it is conducted to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve near the fourth ventricle. The long posterior ciliary nerve arises from the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve.

The optic nerve is one of the main cranial nerves coming from the brain. Understanding the Retina: A Quick Anatomy Lesson. The retina, a light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, plays a crucial role in vision by capturing and processing visual information before sending it to the brain.

It delivers nourishment (through blood and oxygen supply) to the retina's outer layers. In short, the choroid is the source of life that keeps the retina functioning effectively. The choroid also reflects light, which causes the red-eye effect in photographs. 8. Retina The Incredible Anatomy of the Retina. The retina is a multi-layered tissue that lines the back wall of the eye. Consisting of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors, the retina measures only about 0.5 mm in thickness. Light enters through the eye's lens and travels to the retina, where the photoreceptors receive the light signals ... The retina is the innermost layer of the eye.

      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three phakic PACG eyes with patent laser peripheral iridotomy and IOP uncontrolled on maximum tolerable antiglaucoma medications (AGMs), scheduled for trabeculectomy, were given a trial of MP-TSCPC (810 nm laser, 2000 mw power for 180 seconds, 360 degrees). The primary outcome measure was a success at 1 year with IOP ≤18 mm Hg and ≤15 mm Hg with (qualified success) or without (absolute success) AGMs after a single session of MP laser. Secondary outcome measures were changes in pupillary diameter, visual acuity, central macular thickness, and subjective pain perception.\n",

The baseline IOP was 25.7±5.3 mm Hg, which reduced to 17.9±4.6 mm Hg at the end of 12 months (P<0.0001). Twenty eyes (62.5%) achieved qualified success, and 1 eye (3.125%) had absolute success at 12 months for IOP ≤18 mm Hg; 6 eyes (18.75%) had qualified success, and 1 eye (3.125%) had absolute success for IOP ≤15 mm Hg at 12 months follow-up. A significant reduction was also observed in the number of AGMs (4.4±0.8 at baseline to 2.9±1.1 at 12 months; P <0.0001).

Intraocular pressure (IOP), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), use of supplemental antiglaucoma medical therapy, surgery success rates, and complications for both procedures were assessed. Results: The average follow-up period was 50.3 ± 18.7 months in the Phaco-GSL group and 61.2 ± 15.1 months in the TRB group.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "We report a three-pronged phenotypic evaluation of the bioprecursor prodrug 10β,17β-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED) that selectively produces 17β-estradiol (E2) in the retina after topical administration and halts glaucomatous neurodegeneration in a male rat model of the disease. Ocular hypertension (OHT) was induced by hyperosmotic saline injection into an episcleral vein of the eye. Animals received daily DHED eye drops for 12 weeks. Deterioration of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity by OHT in these animals were markedly prevented by the DHED-derived E2 with concomitant preservation of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. In addition, we utilized targeted retina proteomics and a previously established panel of proteins as preclinical biomarkers in the context of OHT-induced neurodegeneration as a characteristic process of the disease. The prodrug treatment provided retina-targeted remediation against the glaucomatous dysregulations of these surrogate endpoints without increasing circulating E2 levels. Collectively, the demonstrated significant neuroprotective effect by the DHED-derived E2 in the selected animal model of glaucoma supports the translational potential of our presented ocular neuroprotective approach owing to its inherent therapeutic safety and efficacy.\n",

RESULTS: The incidence of open-angle glaucoma and OHT was significantly higher in patients receiving steroid injections compared to controls. The risk was particularly elevated in those receiving multiple injections. CONCLUSION: Steroid injections, particularly multiple doses, are associated with an increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma and OHT.

Intraocular pressure (IOP) values were monitored for a period of 6 months following intravitreal injection(s) and patients were categorized as steroid-responders (SR): IOP≥21 mm Hg, and steroid non-responders (NR): IOP≤20 mm Hg. Glaucoma patients, glaucoma suspects, uveitis, trauma, and less than 1 month of IOP follow-up cases were excluded from the study. The incidence of IOP rise, time and magnitude of IOP rise, and its management procedures were studied. Ocular and systemic associations with OHT incidence were investigated.

      "RESULT: Twenty-eight percent of TA and 17% of Dex administered eyes developed OHT. Male subjects and elderly people (greater than 40 years of age) are at higher risk for OHT following steroid treatment. A high percentage of IOP rise was observed on day 1 (41%) for TA-SR, and after 1 month (50%) for Dex-SR. IOP rise was found to be more severe (>30 mm Hg) for TA-SR compared to Dex-SR (p = 0.006). 6% TA-SR required trabeculectomy with medically uncontrollable IOP.

      "PURPOSE: The aim is to analyze the surgical outcomes of glaucomatous patients with steroid treatment and investigate the factors, including atopic dermatitis, associated with the surgical success rate.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled participants who required first trabeculotomy for glaucoma with steroid treatment between May 2005 and February 2018 and then compared the postoperative outcomes according to the history of atopic dermatitis or surgical procedures. Surgical success was defined as postoperative IOP ≤ 21 mmHg, ≥20% reduction from baseline, and absence of reoperation. The factors influencing the surgical success rates were investigated using mixed-effects Cox regression.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 70 eyes of 46 patients (18 eyes of 12 patients with atopic dermatitis). Postoperative intraocular pressure was not significantly different between eyes with and without atopic dermatitis (12 months after the surgery: patients without atopic dermatitis, 15.4 ± 3.6 mmHg; patients with atopic dermatitis, 16.1 ± 3.9 mmHg; P = 0.65). Twelve months after the surgery, the number of postoperative medications was higher in patients with atopic dermatitis than in those without (2.8 ± 1.3 vs. 2.0 ± 1.7; P = 0.060). However, no significant differences were noted in surgical success rates between patients with atopic dermatitis and those without ( = 0.54). Mixed-effects Cox regression of surgical success rate indicated that only the number of preoperative medications significantly influenced surgical success (P = 0.03).\n",

      "Vitreous hemorrhage is associated with a myriad of conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy following vascular occlusion and vasculitis, trauma, retinal breaks, and posterior vitreous detachment without retinal break. Multiple pathological mechanisms are associated with development of vitreous hemorrhage such as disruption of abnormal vessels, normal vessels, and extension of blood from an adjacent source. The diagnosis of vitreous hemorrhage requires a thorough history taking and clinical examination including investigations such as ultra-sonography, which help decide the appropriate time for intervention. The prognosis of vitreous hemorrhage depends on the underlying cause. Treatment options include observation, laser photo-coagulation, cryotherapy, intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, and surgery. Pars plana vitrectomy remains the cornerstone of management. Complications of vitreous hemorrhage include glaucoma (ghost cell glaucoma, hemosiderotic glaucoma), proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and hemosiderosis bulbi.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Brimonidine tartrate is a commonly used eyedrop for short- and long-term lowering of intraocular pressure. Its use has been popularized due to its effects on aqueous suppression and uveoscleral outflow, as well as the suggestion of neuroprotection. Although available with alternative preservative vehicles, brimonidine is associated with high rates of local allergy and is contraindicated in breastfeeding women, neonates, young children, and the elderly due to risk of central nervous system depression. Other topical agents with differing advantages have challenged brimonidine's role in the treatment algorithm of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Areas covered: The authors review the development of topical alpha-adrenergic agonists, with particular attention to the currently available formulations of brimonidine tartrate. Its mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics and safety, and clinical efficacy are analyzed. Expert opinion: Despite clinical familiarity with brimonidine after two decades of use, agents that offer daily dosing, nocturnal effect, and more favorable ocular and systemic side effect profiles have ultimately led to brimonidine's adjunctive use in patients with elevated intraocular pressure or high- or low-tension glaucomas. Still, brimonidine may be advantageous in patients undergoing laser trabeculoplasty or iridotomy, in certain forms of glaucoma, or in pregnant individuals prior to the last trimester, underscoring its clinical importance.\n",

      "METHODS: Rosacea treatments showing efficacy in randomized controlled trials were searched through DailyMed to review pregnancy labelling. Searching the PubMed/MEDLINE database for English articles using keywords \"rosacea fulminans AND pregnancy\" without publishing-time restrictions yielded 8 articles. We summarized treatments used in cases of RF during pregnancy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Topical ivermectin was more effective than metronidazole, but has a more concerning pregnancy category.

      "The red reflex test, performed using a direct ophthalmoscope, serves as a critical diagnostic tool in identifying various ocular conditions. These conditions encompass retinal anomalies (such as retinoblastoma, Coats disease, retinopathy of prematurity, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, myelinated nerve fibers, ocular toxocariasis, ocular toxoplasmosis, retinochoroidal coloboma, astrocytic, and combined hamartoma), vitreous abnormalities (including persistent fetal vasculature), lens issues (like cataract), anterior chamber and corneal conditions (comprising dysgenesis of the anterior segment, congenital glaucoma, birth trauma), and tear film disturbances. During this examination, the presence of leukocoria, characterized by a white pupillary reflex, can suggest the presence of underlying conditions. Any suspicion of an abnormal red reflex test warrants immediate evaluation by a qualified ophthalmologist. This article primarily underscores the paramount importance of the red reflex examination, not only to identify potential sight-threateningbut also life-threatening conditions. It delves into the most common causes of leukocoria in childhood and offers insights into a comprehensive diagnostic approach.

This study was conducted to compare the posterior corneal morphology in areas with DM breaks with regards to DM and pre-Descemet's layer (PDL) between the two. In this cross-sectional comparative study, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) scans of the posterior cornea of advanced keratoconus eyes with hydrops ( n = 12), PCG eyes with Haab's striae ( n = 15), and healthy control eyes ( n = 14) were compared for DM-PDL morphology. These were further corroborated by the histopathology of corneal buttons from keratoconus ( n = 14) and PCG ( n = 13) cases obtained following penetrating keratoplasty and compared with controls (enucleated retinoblastoma globes, n = 6) on light microscopy and collagen IV immunostaining. AS-OCT showed a thicker median DM/PDL complex in PCG (80 µm) versus keratoconus eyes (36 µm, P = 0.01; Kruskal-Wallis test). The median height and length of detached DM-PDL were significantly more in keratoconus versus PCG (145 μm, 1766.1 ± 1320.6 μm vs. 26.5 μm, 453.3 ± 303.2 μm, respectively, P = 0.012; Kruskal-Wallis test).

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: Visual acuity (VA) is a critical component of the eye examination but is often only documented in electronic health records (EHRs) as unstructured free-text notes, making it challenging to use in research. This study aimed to improve on existing rule-based algorithms by developing and evaluating deep learning models to perform named entity recognition of different types of VA measurements and their lateralities from free-text ophthalmology notes: VA for each of the right and left eyes, with and without glasses correction, and with and without pinhole.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "SUBJECTS: A total of 319 756 clinical notes with documented VA measurements from approximately 90 000 patients were included.\n",
      "METHODS: The notes were split into train, validation, and test sets. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models were fine-tuned to identify VA measurements from the progress notes and included BERT models pretrained on biomedical literature (BioBERT), critical care EHR notes (ClinicalBERT), both (BlueBERT), and a lighter version of BERT with 40% fewer parameters (DistilBERT). A baseline rule-based algorithm was created to recognize the same VA entities to compare against BERT models.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model performance was evaluated on a held-out test set using microaveraged precision, recall, and F1 score for all entities.\n",
      "RESULTS: On the human-annotated subset, BlueBERT achieved the best microaveraged F1 score (F1 = 0.92), followed by ClinicalBERT (F1 = 0.91), DistilBERT (F1 = 0.90), BioBERT (F1 = 0.84), and the baseline model (F1 = 0.83).

But when it comes down to it, Trivex pulls ahead of polycarbonate in a few key areas: Higher Abbe Value. Prescription glasses made from Trivex have a higher Abbe value of 43 to 45 than polycarbonate's Abbe value of 30. Think of the Abbe value as a clarity score. The higher the score, the sharper and less blurry your vision will be. While Trivex has a slightly lower refractive index (1.53 compared to 1.58), it's specific gravity, 1.11g/cm3, makes it the lightest of any lens material available today. Like polycarbonate, Trivex also has inherent UV protection. However, unlike polycarbonate, Trivex has an Abbe value of 45, making it optically superior on paper.\u001b[0m\n",

      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Manual wheelchair users, aged 18-65 years old living in the United Kingdom, were invited, to complete an online cross-sectional questionnaire. The link to the questionnaire was distributed using a range of methods to charities, organisations and wheelchair user groups  invitation by email and social media. Responses were gathered from 122 respondents and analysed using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation and content analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Respondents felt comfort (39.3%), weight (35.4%), manoeuvrability (34.3%) and durability (30.7%) were the most important features of a wheelchair. Seventy percent of respondents that were \"not at all satisfied\" with their current wheelchair were fitted by the National Health Service (NHS,  = 42.39,  < 0.001). Ninety percent of respondents who were \"not at all satisfied\" with their current wheelchair experienced issues with comfort ( = 17.82,  = 0.001). Sixty percent who were \"not satisfied at all\" with their wheelchair had not chosen their wheelchair ( = 25.15,  < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Wheelchair satisfaction was largely determined by comfort, location of the users' wheelchair fitting (for example the NHS) and users choosing their own wheelchair.

According to a recent article on eyesurgeryguide.org, LASIK surgery can typically correct up to 6 diopters of nearsightedness, 3 diopters of astigmatism, and 4 diopters of farsightedness. This can be done using the Hofstetter's equation below. Minimum AA = 15-0.25 (age in years) Average AA = 18.5-0.30 (age in years) Maximum AA = 25-0.40 (age in years) Exercises to Improve Amplitude of Accommodation.

The ... The Role of Diopter in Vision Correction. When it comes to correcting vision issues like nearsightedness or farsightedness, the diopter measurement on your prescription indicates the amount of lens power needed to correct your vision to the standard 20/20. This number will be negative for nearsightedness (myopia) and positive for farsightedness ... This indicates that you have 2.50 diopters of myopia in that particular eye. The higher the number on your myopia degree chart, the more severe your myopia. For example, a measurement of -1.00 D indicates mild myopia, while a measurement of -6.00 D indicates high myopia.

Common causes of esotropia include muscle imbalance, refractive errors, and neurological conditions. Non-surgical treatment options for esotropia may include eyeglasses, vision therapy, and eye patching. Esotropia is a type of strabismus characterized by the inward turning of one or both eyes. This misalignment can be constant or intermittent and affects both children and adults. Various factors can cause esotropia, including eye muscle problems, nerve damage, or refractive errors. Non-Surgical Treatment Options for Alternating Esotropia. Correcting Refractive Errors. One common non-surgical approach is the use of prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct any refractive errors that may be contributing to the eye misalignment. This can help improve vision and reduce the severity of the condition. Infantile esotropia has a constant angle of esodeviation, meaning the eye turn is constant. If only one eye is frequently affected, the child is at a higher risk of lazy eyes . According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, intermittent esotropia is normal up to 3 months after birth and resolves on its own. The most common causes of strabismus in children typically include: Muscle imbalance. Weak eye structure or hyperactive eye muscles can prevent proper eye control, leading to misalignment.

Clinical characteristics, including gender, age, SE, angle of esodeviation, accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio, near-distance disparity (NDD) and anatomical features of the rectus muscles were compared among different PAET subgroups. Multiple linear regression was used to identify independent factors that influenced the therapeutic effect of a hyperopic correction on esotropia.\n",

The incidence of SE in PAET participants >9 years old was significantly greater than in those <5 and 6-8 years of age. The therapeutic effect of hyperopic correction on esotropia was positively associated with SE both at distance and near. In addition, the limbus insertion distance (LID) of the lateral rectus (LR) muscle was positively associated with NDD at distance, but negatively associated at near.\n",

NPC, exodeviation greater at near, fusional convergence at near, and the convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS) have all been proposed for screening/diagnosis of convergence insufficiency. Debate continues over exact measurement techniques for each test as well as accepted normative values. Near point of convergence was measured using an accommodative target. The measurement of fusional vergence amplitude (prism dioptres), both for distance and near vision, was conducted using a prism bar with step vergence. The evaluation included both negative fusional vergence and PFV. However, both tests displayed wide LoA when measuring convergence and divergence break points, indicating they should not be used interchangeably in clinic to measure horizontal fusional vergences. A prospective study also found fusional vergence dysfunction in adult AACE, with reduced fusional convergence amplitude and increased fusional divergence amplitude, which may be an adaptive phenomenon for esotropia to maintain fusion in AACE patients [ 24 ].\u001b[0m\n",

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are the main therapeutic regimen for primary myelofibrosis which harbors gene mutations, resulting in continuous activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Since JAK inhibitors modulate immunological state, the administration would have a potential for uveitis. A 67-year-old patient presented with weight loss of 10 kg in the past 2 years after his retirement. He showed normocytic anemia with anisocytosis and abnormal shape, as well as hepatosplenomegaly. Suspected of hematological malignancy, bone marrow biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis (grade 2) with bizarre megakaryocytes and relative maintenance of myeloid and erythroid lineage. He started to have blood transfusion. Genomic DNA analysis of the peripheral blood showed a pathogenic variant in the exon 9 of calreticulin () gene while pathogenic variants in Janus kinase-2 (), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene () were absent. He began to have oral ruxolitinib 10 mg daily at the timepoint of 5 months after the initial visit and the dose was increased to 20 mg daily 8 months later but was discontinued further 4 months later because he showed the limited effect of ruxolitinib.

Optometrists should take into consideration the size of the patient's pupil when interpreting the scissor reflex. Another factor that can affect the scissor reflex is the presence of astigmatism. Astigmatism occurs when the cornea or lens has an irregular shape, causing light to be focused unevenly on the retina. During this test, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will use a phoropter, a device with multiple lenses, to determine the strength of lenses you need to correct your vision.

Depending on the orientation of the previously mentioned refractive planes, regular astigmatism can be termed with-the-rule (WTR), against-the-rule (ATR), or oblique. The direction of the steepest meridian, or more-plus power, correlates with the terminology applied. ... Oblique astigmatism is assigned when the steeper plane falls between 30 to ... In against-the-rule astigmatism, a plus cylinder is added in the horizontal axis (or a minus cylinder in the vertical axis). ... For oblique astigmatism, the prevalence range is from 2 to 61%. [33] With-the-rule astigmatism is more prevalent in young adults, and over time, the prevalence shifts to be mostly against-the-rule astigmatism. [37] With astigmatism, light rays do not refract (or bend) properly as they enter the front of the eye. Vision is blurry at near and far because light rays either fall short of the retina or behind it. farsightedness (hyperopia).

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mIf your prescription reads -2.00, it means you're nearsighted and you require 2 diopters of strength to correct your vision. Since the minus or plus sign simply indicates if you're near or farsighted, the higher the number always means you need more correction to see clearly. -5.00 is higher than -2.00, for instance. Myopia (nearsightedness) is a common condition that's usually diagnosed before age 20. It affects your distance vision — you can see objects that are near, but you have trouble viewing objects that are farther away like grocery store aisle markers or road signs. Myopia treatments include glasses, contact lenses or surgery. Myopia, for example, can develop in early childhood and progress as children grow. However, myopia control measures can help manage myopia symptoms and prevent myopia progression. Healthy Long-Term Vision. Myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are common vision conditions that can affect individuals of all ages. With younger children or others who cannot read an eye chart, your ophthalmologist may use a retinoscope to measure where light is being aimed inside the eye. This allows an ophthalmologist to properly measure the prescription of your eyes. How Is Farsightedness Corrected? Farsightedness is easily corrected with: Eyeglasses or contact lenses. The easiest and safest treatment option for myopia and hyperopia is to wear glasses. Depending on the results of your eye exam, your doctor will write an eyeglasses prescription to correct your vision. Contacts. Contact lenses create the first surface that refracts light entering the eye. Wearing contact lenses is another way to correct ...\u001b[0m\n",

The question seems to focus on whether moving away from the chart would lead to undercorrection or overcorrection in a myopic patient. Given that moving away from the chart might make it harder to see clearly for a myopic patient, it could lead to an underestimation of the degree of myopia during an eye exam.\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mTo read a myopia degree chart, start by identifying the numbers associated with each eye. The numbers may be written as a negative sign followed by a numerical value, such as -2.50 D. This indicates that you have 2.50 diopters of myopia in that particular eye. The higher the number on your myopia degree chart, the more severe your myopia. Nearsightedness (myopia) is when close-up objects look clear but distant objects are blurry. For instance, you can read a map clearly but have trouble seeing well enough to drive a car. Nearsightedness is a common eye focusing disorder. It has been on the rise for several decades. A recent study demonstrated that myopia progressed at a slightly slower rate in children with uncorrected myopia compared to those that had their myopia corrected. 4 The uncorrected children with a median age of 12.7 years at enrolment, progressed by - 0.75D over two years, while the fully corrected children progressed by -1.04D. Common Types of Vision Problems Myopia (Nearsightedness) Causes Myopia occurs when the eye's physical structure leads to light focusing in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This can happen for several reasons: Axial Length: A common eyeball disease, myopia, occurs when there is an elongation of the eyeball (increased axial length). A visual acuity score results from a visual acuity test performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist during an eye exam. Visual acuity scores are usually written as a fraction. These test results describe your ability to see an object 20 feet away compared to a person with normal vision. For example, 20/20 vision means seeing an object ...\u001b[0m\n",

Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common vision condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the eyeball is too long or the cornea is too curved, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in blurred distance vision, while close-up objects remain clear. Myopia can have a significant impact on an individual's quality ... Your eye strain may be from trying to read without this near vision correction in your glasses. But, if the spectacle prescription is correct and the vertex distance is included (distance from your cornea to the back of your spectacle lens—it may or may not be needed), then the extra 0.5 diopter should have little or no effect on your correction. An eye doctor diagnoses nearsightedness as part of a comprehensive eye examination. In patients old enough to read the letters on an eye chart, your ophthalmologist can use a machine called a phoropter to measure your glasses prescription and diagnose nearsightedness. Vision Accuracy: Maintaining the correct vertex distance is crucial for ensuring that your prescription lenses provide you with accurate vision correction. If the lenses are too far from your eyes, the effective power of a minus lens will be minimized and the effective power of a plus lens will be amplified, leading to blurry or distorted vision.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe information gathered indicates that if a myopic patient stands further away from the vision chart than usual and this is not accounted for by the ophthalmologist, the effective power of the minus lens (used for myopia correction) will be minimized. This would lead to a prescription that is too weak, meaning the patient's myopia would be under-corrected.\n",

An examination room at an eye doctor's office usually consists of an exam chair, a phoropter, an eye chart, a slit lamp, and a stool for the eye care practitioner.

Notice that while the focal length of a reflector is shorter than the radius of the mirror, for a refractor it is longer. So Equation 4.4.4 can be written in terms of the focal length as: n1 s + n2 s ′ = n2 f. The ray traces of the other three cases look different from case 1: Lensometry measures the strength and prescription of eyeglasses or contact lenses using a lensmeter, an instrument sometimes referred to as a focimeter, vertometer, or Lensometer™.

But, if the spectacle prescription is correct and the vertex distance is included (distance from your cornea to the back of your spectacle lens—it may or may not be needed), then the extra 0.5 diopter should have little or no effect on your correction. The cylinder induced by a tilted spherical IOL increases with the power of the lens and is approximately proportional to the square of the tilt angle, 2, 3 although this is also somewhat influenced by the shape of the IOL. 2 Few theoretical papers have investigated the effects of tilt on refractive correction, particularly regarding toric IOLs.

J Cataract Refract Surg ... The timeline for getting glasses for astigmatism can vary depending on several factors. Firstly, it depends on how quickly you can schedule an eye exam and obtain a prescription. It is recommended to schedule an eye exam as soon as you notice any signs or symptoms of astigmatism to ensure timely correction. The axis helps in the following ways: Pinpoints the Astigmatism: The axis provides the exact location, like a map coordinate, guiding where the corrective power should be applied on the lens.

This number can also be positive or negative depending on the type of doctor you see. Most ophthalmologists use plus cylinder and optometrists use minus cylinder. The basic unit of measurement in optometry, diopters, is used to express the optical power of prescription lenses. They are made expressly to gauge the way a lens bends or refracts light to properly focus it onto the retina. The incapacity of the eye to bend light properly is the cause of vision issues such as astigmatism, presbyopia, hyperopia ...

Symptoms of astigmatism include blurry vision, eye strain, headaches, and difficulty seeing at night. where r f and r s refer to the flattest and steepest anterior corneal radii of curvature and 1.3375 is the calibrated refractive index value after considering the posterior cornea contribution []..

A keratometer is an optical instrument designed for measuring the curvature of the anterior surface of the cornea, specifically across a fixed chord length typically ranging from 2 to 3 millimeters. The term \"keratometry\" is derived from \" kerato ,\" referring to the cornea, and \" metry ,\" indicating measurement. This is measured in diopters. Most people with astigmatism have between 0.5-0.75 diopters; you probably need prescription lenses for a diopter measurement of 1.5 or higher. The third number is for \"axis\" and goes from 0 to 180, which is a degree measurement of where on your cornea the astigmatism is located. Method 2.

Corrective lenses are only good for those with a difference between their eyes of 4D or less. Children under 12 and those with severe anisometropia are generally advised to use contacts, while others can often use glasses for correction. A slab-off prism is generally recommended when anisometropia causes problems due to different prismatic effects. These effects come into play when the wearer of bifocal lenses or progressives performs eye movements up and down, for example, to switch from distance vision into reading distance. Typical problems that indicate a need for a slab ... Causes of anisometropia include genetics, trauma, and eye surgery. Preoperative assessment and diagnosis are crucial for determining the severity of anisometropia. Choosing the right intraocular lens is important for correcting anisometropia. Postoperative management and long-term follow-up are necessary for maintaining anisometropia correction. In the case of binocular diplopia, diagnostic and neurological testing may need to be done to figure out what the underlying issue may be. Treatment for double vision is dependent on the type and cause of the disorder. It can include wearing an eye patch, eye exercises, specialty glasses, or surgery. Lots of eye problems can cause double vision. Anything that affects your brain, your eyes or the nerves and muscles that control them can lead to diplopia. Some examples include: Astigmatism.

Binocular diplopia is double vision caused by a misalignment of the eyes. Binocular double vision has many causes, including problems with the eye muscles, neurological and neuromuscular disorders, damage to the cranial nerves, and brainstem disorders. Monocular and binocular diplopia may be differentiated by covering one eye. If you have binocular double vision caused by seeing two conflicting images, then your eye doctor may recommend occlusion therapy. This involves patching one eye or blocking off one of the lenses on your glasses. This only allows one image through and can be continued until the double vision dissipates and the patch is no longer needed. Double vision, the common name for diplopia, is seeing two images of the same object instead of one for some or all of the time. The two images may be vertically separated (one on top of the other), horizontally separated (side by side) or a combination of both. Although we see with two eyes, we normally have single vision, meaning we see only ... In the case of binocular diplopia, diagnostic and neurological testing may need to be done to figure out what the underlying issue may be.

      "The association between empty sella turcica (EST) syndrome and Cushing's disease has been rarely reported.

In this case report, we present a 47-year-old male patient who presented with weight loss, fatigue, easy bruising, acanthosis nigricans, and skin creases hyperpigmentation. Investigations revealed hypokalemia and confirmed the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed a partial EST syndrome and a new pituitary nodule as compared with previous brain imaging. Transsphenoidal surgery was pursued and was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid leakage. This case reflects the rare association of EST syndrome and Cushing's disease, suggesting the increased risk of postoperative complications in this setting and the diagnostic challenge that EST syndrome imposes. We review the literature for a possible mechanism of this association.\n",

Distinct neuroimaging findings are associated with IH, yet their discriminative power, reversibility and factors favoring normalization in prospective CVT patients are unknown. We determined test performance measures of neuroimaging signs in acute CVT patients, their longitudinal change under anticoagulation, association with IH at baseline and with recanalization at follow-up.\n",
      "METHODS: We included 26 consecutive acute CVT patients and 26 healthy controls. Patients were classified as having IH based on CSF pressure > 25 cmHO and/or papilledema on ophthalmological examination or ocular MRI. We assessed optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), optic nerve tortuousity, bulbar flattening, lateral and IV ventricle size, pituitary configuration at baseline and follow-up, and their association with IH and venous recanalization.\n",
      "RESULTS: 46% of CVT patients had IH. ONSD enlargement > 5.8 mm, optic nerve tortuousity and pituitary grade ≥ III had highest sensitivity, ocular bulb flattening and pituitary grade ≥ III highest specificity for IH. Only ONSD reliably discriminated IH at baseline. Recanalization was significantly associated with regressive ONSD and pituitary grade. Other neuroimaging signs tended to regress with recanalization. After treatment, 184.9 ± 44.7 days after diagnosis, bulbar flattening resolved, whereas compared with controls ONSD enlargement (p < 0.001) and partially empty sella (p = 0.017), among other indicators, persisted.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities encountered in medical practice and is caused by multiple conditions. SIADH is the most common cause of hyponatremia, however, careful workup must be performed on all patients as mere supplementation may cause recurrent hyponatremia and serious side effects. Adrenal insufficiency is a principal culprit that mimics the clinical picture of SIADH and tends to worsen when treated in the line of SIADH. In addition, individuals may have various comorbidities, such as hypothyroidism in our case, which can also cause hyponatremia, making it difficult to determine precise etiology. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with recurrent hyponatremia, who was subsequently diagnosed as partially empty sella syndrome. Given the temporal relationship between the use of corticosteroids and the improvement of his symptoms, low cortisol and ACTH levels, adrenal insufficiency was most likely the cause of the hyponatremia in our patient.\n",

Empty sella, also known as arachnoidocele, is a radiologic finding in which the sella turcica appears empty due to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) within the subarachnoid space herniating into the sella turcica. Subsequently, the pituitary gland contained in the sella turcica is compressed and flattened, and the pituitary stalk is stretched by the CSF, which fills the space.[1][2] Over the years ... When the sella turcica becomes partially or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid, it causes the pituitary gland to become flattened against the bony wall of the sella turcica. Because most of the sella is now filled with fluid instead of tissue, on medical imaging studies it appears to be empty. This condition is called the \"empty sella ... Pituitary gland.

      "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Primary intracranial neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are exceedingly rare, often posing diagnostic challenges, particularly in non-secreting variants. These tumors may initially present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and potential neurological complications.\n",
      "CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 33-year-old male admitted with a one-year history of progressively worsening headache accompanied by acute left ptosis and diplopia. Initial examination revealed left eye ptosis and hypotropia, indicative of third and fourth cranial nerve paralysis. Cavoscopy revealed a mild anterior wall bulge of the sphenoid with normal mucosa. MRI imaging unveiled an expansive clival process extending towards the sellar region and left cavernous sinus, completely occupying the sphenoid sinus and exerting mass effect on the pituitary stalk. Hormonal assays were within reference ranges, ruling out a hormonally-active tumor. Endoscopic endonasal surgery for biopsy revealed a low-grade neuroendocrine tumor positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE2, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and beta-catenin, with a Ki-67-labeling index <2 %. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy confirmed intense hyper fixation of the tracer in the sphenoidal tumor, supporting its neuroendocrine origin.

During the procedure, the belly of the inferior oblique muscle was fixed to the sclera at 5 mm posterior to the temporal insertion of the inferior rectus muscle. The following indicators were reviewed pre- and post-surgery: the vertical deviation (VD) in the primary position and in the Bielschowsky test, the fovea disc angle (FDA) of the affected eye, changes in IOOA, and diplopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: After IOBT, the VD in the primary position decreased from 7.22 ± 1.72 (range 4-10) to 1.22 ± 1.30 (range 0-3).

      "This retrospective study aimed to compare objective/subjective torsion and other clinical characteristics of patients with acquired trochlear nerve palsy. This study included 82 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with acquired fourth cranial nerve palsy between 2014 and 2021 and who were followed up for ≥ 6 months. The etiologies, ocular deviation, objective and subjective torsions were reviewed. The etiologies were classified as ischemic, traumatic, brain lesion, idiopathic, or other. The patients were classified into two groups according to the recovery state: full recovery and partial/no-recovery. We compared the torsion and clinical features based on the etiology and recovery state. The average age was 59.1 ± 11.1 years, and 58 (71.0%) of the patients were male. The most common cause was ischemic (n = 49, 59.7%) and other common causes included traumatic (n = 16, 19.5%), brain lesion (n = 8, 9.8%), idiopathic (n = 5, 6.1%) and others (n = 4, 4.9%). Of the 82 patients, 56 (68.3%) were assigned to the full recovery group, and 26 (31.7%) were assigned to the partial/no-recovery group. The average age and number of patients with ischemic causes of palsy were greater in the full recovery group (p = 0.026 and p < 0.000, respectively). The vertical deviation angle, tilted angle on the Lancaster red-green test (LRGT), proportion of patients who experienced subjective torsion on the LRGT, and head tilt were smaller in the full recovery group (p = 0.037, 0.042, 0.045, and 0.006, respectively). Ischemic trochlear nerve palsy, advanced age, a small deviation angle at the primary position, and few cases of excyclotorsion on LRGT were characteristic of the full recovery group of acquired unilateral trochlear nerve palsy patients.\n",

      "Pregnant and postpartum women with a history of bariatric surgery are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies as a result of the combination of physiologic changes related to pregnancy and iatrogenic postoperative alterations in the absorption and metabolism of crucial nutrients. This systematic review investigates micronutrient deficiencies and related adverse clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery. A systematic approach involving critical appraisal was conducted independently by 2 researchers to examine deficiencies of phylloquinone, folate, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, iodide, copper, and vitamins A, D, and B-12 in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery, together with subsequent outcomes in the neonates. The search identified 29 relevant cases and 8 cohort studies. The quality of reporting among the case reports was weak according to the criteria based on the CARE (CAse REporting) guidelines as was that for the cohort studies based on the criteria from the Cohort Study Quality Assessment list of the Dutch Cochrane Center. The most common adverse neonatal outcomes related to maternal micronutrient deficiencies include visual complications (vitamin A), intracranial hemorrhage (phylloquinone), neurological and developmental impairment (vitamin B-12), and neural tube defects (folate). On the basis of the systematically collected information, we conclude that the evidence on micronutrient deficiencies in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery and subsequent adverse neonatal outcomes remains weak and inconclusive.\u001b[0m\n",

      "METHODS: A retrospective observational study of four males (ages 9-12), three with autism spectrum disorder who presented with loss of vision and multiple vitamin deficiencies including hypovitaminosis A.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients presented with unexplained visual loss or a change in visual behaviour. All patients had severely restricted diet comprising of predominantly carbohydrates. Two of the four cases demonstrated optic nerve pallor at initial presentation with marked optic atrophy developing in all patients over time. Electrophysiology available in two patients demonstrated optic nerve dysfunction with preserved retinal function. Extensive investigations revealed profound deficiency in multiple vitamins including vitamin A (<0.1-0.2 μmol/L, normal = 0.9-1.7 μmol/L). Three patients also had low vitamin B12 (90-111 pmol/L, normal = 170-800 pmol/L) with normal folate. All four cases had radiological evidence of skull base thickening indicative of low vitamin A. Genetic testing did not find any relevant pathogenic variants.\n",

Anisocoria is an essential biomarker in diagnosing the neurological worsening of a patient [1, 2].It is defined as unequal pupil size [], and it has historically been measured using different criteria to define its presence [3,4,5].The cutoff measurements for defining anisocoria have varied from a difference of 0.4 mm to a difference of 2.0 mm in pupil diameter [6,7,8]. Anisocoria can be caused by lots of health conditions and injuries, and can be a side effect of some medications. It can also happen without a known cause (idiopathic anisocoria).

      "RESULT: Nine children diagnosed with uveitis and one with scleritis received oral tofacitinib treatment. The median age of these patients was 9 years, with bilateral involvement observed in nine of them. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis was the most identifiable cause of uveitis, with anterior uveitis (50%) being the most frequent subtype of inflammation among these children. The median duration of immunosuppressive treatment before switching to tofacitinib was 18 (16-49) months. Remission of uveitis was achieved in all but two children, who experienced recurrence - manifesting as anterior uveitis. The median duration of follow-up in these children after tofacitinib treatment was 277.5 (183-549) days. At the end of follow-up, topical steroids could be withdrawn in six children, and two children were on topical steroids once a day. None of the children developed any systemic side-effect during the follow-up period. The mean BCVA at presentation was 0.62 ± 0.55, which improved to a mean of 0.27 ± 0.325 at the final follow-up ( = 0.0014).\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood, and is associated with uveitis in up to 20-25% of cases. Typically, the uveitis is chronic, asymptomatic, non-granulomatous and anterior. For this reason, screening for uveitis is recommended to identify uveitis early and allow treatment to prevent sight-threatening complications. The management of JIA associated uveitis requires a multidisciplinary approach and a close collaboration between paediatric rheumatologist and ophthalmologist. Starting the appropriate treatment to control uveitis activity and prevent ocular complications is crucial. Current international recommendations advise a step-wise approach, starting with methotrexate and moving on to adalimumab if methotrexate alone is not sufficient to control the disease. If the uveitis remains active despite standard treatment other therapeutic options may be considered including anti-IL6 or other anti-TNF agents such as infliximab, although the evidence for these agents is limited.\n",

Therapeutic monitoring of cyclosporine in transplant patients is a valuable tool in adjusting drug dosage to prevent acute rejection, nephrotoxicity, and predictable dose-dependent adverse reactions.

Prior to initiation of cyclosporine therapy, perform careful physical examination of the patient, including measurement of BP on ≥2 occasions and determination of S cr twice for a baseline. Cyclosporine (CsA), used for treating psoriasis and other skin conditions, has several side-effects including laboratory and blood pressure (BP) abnormalities [].CsA laboratory monitoring recommendations range from every 2-4 weeks for the initial 2-3 months, and thereafter every 4-12 weeks, while BP monitoring varies from every visit to biweekly [1, 3, 5].\u001b[0m\n",

Subsequently, a vitrectomy was performed and the FTMH closed. Her visual acuity improved from 20/200 to 20/25. In Case 2, the same medical therapy, with less frequency compared with Case 1, did not affect the PED, and the FTMH failed to close with surgery.

      "OBJECTIVE: Our aim in this study is to compare patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a rheumatologic disease that can cause eye involvement and the normal population in terms of orbital Doppler findings, which is an inexpensive and easily applicable method that can be used in early diagnosis and follow-up.\n",
      "METHODS: The study was planned prospectively. The data of patients with AS were compared to those of age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. A total of 42 participants, 23 (54.8%) males and 19 (45.2%) females, with a mean age of 42.4±12.6 years were included in the study. In addition to demographic information, such as age and gender, the diameter, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, mean velocity, resistive index, pulsatility index, and blood flow volumes of the central retinal artery of the left eye were measured using spectral Doppler ultrasonography.\n",
      "RESULTS: According to the comparison of the patients with and without AS according to orbital Doppler ultrasonography findings, the mean velocity, resistive index, and volume measurements of the patients with AS were significantly higher than those without AS (p=0.028, p=0.039, and p=0.038, respectively). However, in the subgroup analysis of the AS group, the Doppler findings did not significantly differ between the patients with and without anterior uveitis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In the patient group with AS, independent of anterior uveitis (AU), there was a difference in Doppler parameters and therefore in ophthalmic vasculature. In patients with AS, orbital vascularity changes can be detected with orbital Doppler US before clinical signs appear.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Disulfidptosis is a recently identified form of cell death that contributes to maintaining the internal environment balance of an organism. However, the molecular basis of disulfidptosis in ulcerative colitis (UC), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and Crohn's disease (CD) has not been thoroughly explored.\n",
      "METHODS: Firstly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and disulfidptosis-associated genes (DAGs) were obtained through differential analysis between diseases (AS, CD, and UC) and control groups. After the disulfidptosis score was acquired using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm, the DE-DAGs were screened by overlapping DAGs and DEGs of the three diseases. Next, the feature genes were selected through a combination of machine learning algorithms, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and expression analysis. Based on these feature genes, nomograms were created for AS, CD and UC. The co-feature genes were then identified by taking the intersections of the genes featured in all three diseases. Meanwhile, single-gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the TF-mRNA-miRNA network were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the co-feature genes. To validate the expression differences of the co-feature genes between healthy controls and patients (AS and IBD), RT-PCR was performed. Lastly, mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was utilized to explore the causality between genetic variants of  with AS, UC and CD.\n",
      "RESULTS: In this study, 11 DE-DAGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in cytokine production and fatty acid biosynthesis. Latterly, AS/CD/UC -feature genes were derived, and they all had decent diagnostic performanc\u001b[0m\n",

      "METHODS: From the population-based data of all adult patients with AU during 2009-2020 ( = 413), 241 patients tested for HLA-B27 were included. Age of the initial onset, gender, etiology, course of uveitis, visual outcomes and complications were studied.\n",
      "RESULTS: 170 patients (71%) were HLA-B27+ and 71 (29%) HLA-B27-. Mean age at uveitis onset was 37 ± 13 in HLA-B27+ (95% CI, 35.4-39.3) and 43 ± 14 (95% CI, 40.3-46.4) in HLA-B27- patients ( = 0.001). Male:female ratio was 1.1:1 among HLA-B27+ and 0.58:1 ( = 0.024) in HLA-B27- patients. Most patients, 63% in HLA-B27+ and 68% in HLA-B27- had chronic uveitis. Recurrences were noted in 31% in HLA-B27+ group compared to 13%in HLA-B27-. 51% and 17% of HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27- patients, respectively, had systemic disease-associated uveitis. Etiology was Idiopathic in 44% and 69% of HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27- patients, respectively ( < 0.001). After the follow-up, +2 and -4 ETDRS letters changes were noted in HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27- patients ( = 0.005). Ocular complications developed in 43% and 47%, and surgical treatment of complications was required in 20% and 33% of patients in HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27- patients ( = 0.009). 1% (HLA-B27+) and 3% (HLA-B27-) developed visual impairment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the differences in the age of uveitis onset, gender distribution, course of uveitis, etiology, and treatment outcomes in HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27-uveitis. HLA-B27 seems to be associated with younger age at uveitis onset, more recurrences, systemic diseases, and better treatment outcomes with less complications.\n",

A keen understanding of clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiological features is key to timely intervention and development of new treatment modalities. Healing process associated with BM rupture leads to atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer, and at this point, LC become detectable as yellowish linear lesions on fundus examination.

Methods Prospective, observational, case series study performed in 131 patients with the exudative form of nAMD. Patients were randomly assigned into four groups according to the antiangiogenic agent.

The occurrence of RD post-cataract surgery represents a major concern for this demographic.

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Visual outcomes of acute central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO/BRAO) are poor and acute treatment options are limited by delayed diagnosis. In the hyper-acute setting, the ocular fundus may appear \"normal\", making recognition challenging, but is facilitated by retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is seldom available in emergency departments (ED). We evaluated the use of non-mydriatic ocular fundus photographs (NMFP) combined with OCT to facilitate ultra-rapid remote diagnosis and stroke alert for patients with acute vision loss presenting to the ED.\n",
      "METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all CRAO/BRAO between 06/06/2023-06/06/2024 who had NMFP-OCT in our general ED affiliated with a stroke center.\n",
      "RESULTS: Over 1 year, 22 patients were diagnosed with CRAO, 4 with BRAO. Five patients presented within 4.5 hours of vision loss onset, 6 within 4.5 to ≤12 hours and 15 within >12 to 24 hours. On average, NMFP-OCT was performed within 141 minutes of presentation to the ED (range 27- 422 minutes). Diagnosis of acute RAO was made remotely with NMFP-OCT within 4.5 hours in 4 patients, 2 of whom received intravenous thrombolysis. Of the 9 patients with NMFP-OCT within 12 hours of symptom onset, 5 patients had subtle retinal whitening on color fundus photograph, but all had OCT inner retinal hyper-reflectivity/edema.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Implementation of NMFP-OCT in a general ED enables rapid remote diagnosis of CRAO/BRAO and facilitates initiation of an eye stroke protocol in acute patients. OCT complements color fundus photography and provides greater diagnostic accuracy in hyperacute cases with near-normal appearing ocular fundi.\n",

Introduction. X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), also known as congenital or juvenile XLRS, is an inherited retinal disease found in approximately 1:10,000 males caused by variants in retinochisin (RS1) ().RS1 plays an important function in retinal bipolar and photoreceptor cell adhesion and signal transduction ().Macular retinoschisis, observed in 99% of XLRS patients, reduces visual acuity in ... Patients without a genetically confirmed diagnosis were also included when all the following clinical findings were present: an X-linked disease inheritance pattern; decreased visual acuity; and typical central retinoschisis on spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) and/or a spoke-wheel pattern in the macula on fundoscopic examination. X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is an early-onset progressive inherited retinopathy affecting males. It is characterized by abnormalities in the macula, with formation of cystoid retinal cavities, frequently accompanied by splitting of the retinal layers, impaired synaptic transmission of visual signals, and associated loss of visual acuity.

Purpose: Cystoid macular degeneration (CMD) is a feature of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). Present study intended to analyze the clinical presentation, risk factors, choroidal features, and outcome of CMD in CSCR. Methods: This was a retrospective, record-based descriptive study, which included chronic CSCR eyes with CMD. Cystoid macular edema was defined as follows: (1) a documented CME diagnosis was made by the treating clinician and (2) an independent, masked reviewer (Y.S.S. or M.A.) confirmed the presence of CME on OCT. Reviewers analyzed OCT scans for accumulation of intraretinal fluid in well-defined, cystoid spaces. In both cases, the term \"pseudo\" refers to the nonexudative origin of these cystoid spaces. Their presence in neovascular AMD has recently been confirmed by Monje-Fernández et al. Evaluation of non-exudative tomographic signs in cases of exudative age-related macular degeneration.

The patient first presented at the dermatology department due to rapidly evolving brown and black macules on the glans penis. Further skin involvement of the perineal and perianal region, mamillae and oral mucosa was stated. Histology from a penile biopsy was compatible with a melanoma in situ. Due to the distribution pattern and elevated serum tumor marker S100B, metastatic melanoma was considered. Staging examinations using PET-CT scan however, revealed a lung tumor, later confirmed as a Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Primary radio chemotherapy was initiated to treat NSCLC. Shortly after initiation of radio chemotherapy the patient developed massive vision impairment and a NSCLC-associated BDUMP was diagnosed which led to the correct classification of melanocytic skin lesions as mucocutaneous BDUMP manifestation. Plasmapheresis was started resulting in a rapid improvement of vision starting ten days after the first plasmapheresis. In contrast skin manifestations started to disappear with a marked delay 4 months after the last plasmapheresis cycle.

Our everyday choices play a significant role in preventing retinal detachment, an eye condition that can lead to blindness if left unchecked. Incorporating healthy habits can make a world of difference. For starters, consuming a diet rich in vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids nurtures your eyes. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye responsible for sensing light and sending visual signals to the brain, separates from its normal position. This separation can result in the retina being deprived of essential oxygen and nutrients, leading to potential vision loss if not treated promptly. A comprehensive eye examination is essential for diagnosing retinal detachment.

Neither the ICD, 9th Revision, nor its imminent replacement, the ICD, 10th Revision, has specific codes for foot examinations and funduscopic examinations in the asymptomatic person, high-risk diabetic foot status, or clinically significant macular edema. Adoption of official codes for these procedures and conditions implemented in conjunction with computerized databases could be used for surveillance, program planning, and quality of care assessment. Computerized medical records could use the codes to monitor care and issue reminders to patients and providers. Payors could offer reimbursement incentives to encourage compliance with standard recommendations. These codes for care procedures could be linked to outcomes, such as amputations and blindness, to improve our understanding of the etiology of blindness and the relationship between process and outcome. The uniform adoption of these codes would facilitate comparison between health care systems, geographic regions, and nations. The diabetes community should encourage the National Center for Health Statistics to adopt new codes that could be used to monitor diabetes preventive care practices.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: Lens adapted smartphones are being used regularly instead of ophthalmoscopes. The most common causes of preventable blindness in the world, which are glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, can develop asymptomatic changes to the optic nerve head (ONH) especially in the developing world where there is a dire shortage of ophthalmologists but ubiquitous mobile phones. We developed a proof-of-concept ONH biometric (application [APP]) to use as a routine biometric on a mobile phone. The unique blood vessel pattern is verified if it maps on to a previously enrolled image.\n",
      "METHODS: The iKey APP platform comprises three deep neural networks (DNNs) developed from anonymous ONH images: the graticule blood vessel (GBV) and the blood vessel specific feature (BVSF) DNNs were trained on unique blood vessel vectors. A non-feature specific (NFS) baseline ResNet50 DNN was trained for comparison.\n",
      "RESULTS: Verification reached an accuracy of 97.06% with BVSF, 87.24% with GBV and 79.8% using NFS.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A new ONH biometric was developed with a hybrid platform of ONH algorithms for use as a verification biometric on a smartphone. Failure to verify will alert the user to possible changes to the image, so that silent changes may be observed before sight threatening disease progresses. The APP retains a history of all ONH images. Future longitudinal analysis will explore the impact of ONH changes to the iKey biometric platform.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health concern, emphasizing the necessity of early detection to facilitate prompt clinical intervention. Leveraging the unique ability of the retina to offer insights into systemic vascular health, it emerges as an interesting, non-invasive option for early CKD detection. Integrating this approach with existing invasive methods could provide a comprehensive understanding of patient health, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to critically assess the potential of retinal imaging to serve as a diagnostic tool for CKD detection based on retinal vascular changes. The review tracks the evolution from conventional manual evaluations to the latest state-of-the-art in deep learning.\n",
      "SURVEY METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive examination of the literature was carried out, using targeted database searches and a three-step methodology for article evaluation: identification, screening, and inclusion based on Prisma guidelines. Priority was given to unique and new research concerning the detection of CKD with retinal imaging. A total of 70 publications from 457 that were initially discovered satisfied our inclusion criteria and were thus subjected to analysis. Out of the 70 studies included, 35 investigated the correlation between diabetic retinopathy and CKD, 23 centered on the detection of CKD  retinal imaging, and four attempted to automate the detection through the combination of artificial intelligence and retinal imaging.\n",
      "RESULTS: Significant retinal features such as arteriolar narrowing, venular widening, specific retinopathy markers (like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates), and changes in arteriovenous ratio (AVR) have shown strong correlations with CKD progressio\u001b[0m\n",

      "DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and mild NPDR (ETDRS 20 or 35) were followed in a 5-year longitudinal study. Examinations, including color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT and OCTA), were performed at baseline, 6 months and then annually. Phenotype classification was performed based on microaneurysm turnover (MAT, on CFP) and central retinal thickness (CRT, on OCT). Phenotype A is characterized by low MAT (< 6) and normal CRT; Phenotype B by low MAT (< 6) and increased CRT; and Phenotype C by higher MAT (≥ 6) with or without increased CRT. ETDRS grading of seven fields CFP was performed at the initial and last visits.\n",
      "RESULTS: Analysis of ETDRS grade step changes showed significant differences in diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression between the different phenotypes (p < 0.001). Of the 66 participants with phenotype A only 2 eyes (3%) presented 2-or-more-step worsening. None of the 50 participants characterized as phenotype B developed 2-step worsening, whereas 13 eyes (23.2%) characterized as phenotype C had 2-or-more-steps worsening. Phenotype C presents the higher risk for 2-or-more step worsening (OR: 15.94 95% CI: 3.45-73.71; p < 0.001) and higher sensitivity, correctly identifying 86.7% of cases at risk (AUC: 0.84 95% CI: 0.72-0.96; p < 0.001). Diabetic retinopathy severity progression was associated with HbA (p = 0.019), LDL levels (p = 0.043), and ocular factors as MAT (p = 0.010), MA formation rate (p = 0.014) and MA disappearance rate (p = 0.005).

      "Summary::\n",
      "Angioid streaks (AS) are recognized as irregular, linear dehiscences of Bruch's membrane, often associated with systemic diseases. We present the case of a 50-year-old woman initially diagnosed with AS during a routine optometric examination. Subsequent ophthalmological evaluation revealed bilateral AS with calcified drusen. Two years post-diagnosis, she developed blurred vision in her right eye due to the choroidal neovascular membrane adjacent to the macular AS. Further evaluation uncovered clinical signs consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), including characteristic skin lesions. A multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmology, dermatology, and cardiovascular specialists was initiated. Histopathological confirmation of PXE was obtained through a skin biopsy. PXE, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elastin calcification, presents systemic manifestations necessitating comprehensive evaluation and monitoring. This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing ocular complications in PXE and advocates for early multidisciplinary intervention to mitigate potential vision and life-threatening outcomes.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a relatively uncommon autosomal-dominant genetic disorder, primarily attributed to mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene. Albeit the involvement of protein-coding regions of FOXL2 has been observed in the majority of BPES cases, whether deficiencies in regulatory elements lead to the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Herein, an autosomal-dominant BPES type II family was included. Peripheral venous blood has been collected, and genomic DNA has been extracted from leukocytes. A whole exome sequencing analysis has been performed and analyzed (Deposited in NODE database: OER422653). The promoter region of FOXL2 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the activity of this region. In this study, we present a Chinese family diagnosed with type II BPES, characterized by the presence of small palpebral fissures, ptosis, telecanthus, and epicanthus inversus. Notably, all male individuals within the family display polydactyly. A 225-bp deletion in the 556-bp 5'-upstream to transcription start site of FOXL2 , decorated by multiple histone modifications, was identified in affected members of the family. This deletion significantly decreased FOXL2 promoter activity, as measured by the luciferase assay. Conclusively, a novel 255-bp-deletion of the FOXL2 promoter was identified in Chinese families with BPES. Our results expand the spectrum of known FOXL2 mutations and provide additional insight into the genotype-phenotype relationships of the BPES pathogenesis. In addition, this study indicates the important role of genet\u001b[0m\n",

      "-related disorders represent some of the rarest inherited disorders, exhibiting clinical features that overlap with cardiac, facial, and digital anomalies with developmental delay (CAFDADD) syndrome, as well as blepharophimosis-mental retardation syndrome (BMRS). A 36-year-old male, presenting with total blindness, blepharophimosis, and intellectual disability, was admitted for the assessment of resting dyspnea several months previously. He had a history of being diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography unveiled right ventricular dilatation without significant pulmonary hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve with aortic root aneurysm, and aortic regurgitation in the proband. Sanger sequencing identified a de novo  variant (c.1964G>A; p.Arg655Gln). Subsequently, aortic root replacement using the Bentall procedure was performed. However, despite the surgery, he continued to experience dyspnea. Upon re-evaluating OSA with polysomnography, it was discovered that continuous positive airway pressure support alleviated his symptoms. The underlying cause of his symptoms was attributed to OSA, likely exacerbated by the vertebral anomaly and short neck associated with CAFDADD syndrome. Clinicians should be attentive to the symptoms associated with OSA as it is a potentially serious medical condition in patients with  variants.\n",

There are three types of blepharoplasty: lower, upper, and double-eyelid blepharoplasty. Lower blepharoplasty is slightly more complicated than upper blepharoplasty, but it is still a surgery ... Lower Blepharoplasty. Lower eyelid surgery, also referred to as lower blepharoplasty, is a cosmetic surgical procedure intended to target excess skin, bags, dark circles, and puffiness beneath the eyes. This procedure is successful in reducing the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines, leading to a more youthful and refreshed appearance. The exact day for your stitch removal isn't set in stone. It hinges on your personal healing trajectory and the specifics of the blepharoplasty procedure you underwent. Typically, stitches are removed between the 5th and 8th day, but your surgeon will provide a clear timeline tailored to your recovery. Blepharoplasty is a surgical procedure to remove the eye bags and improve the tired-looking appearance of the eyes. This achieves a younger, fresher appearance. An upper blepharoplasty concentrates on the region between the eyebrow and the eyelashes, while the lower eyelid blepharoplasty focuses on the area between the eyelid and the cheek. The concept of lower blepharoplasty has shifted from a pure subtractive surgery to fat reposition, conservative skin excision and blending of the eyelid-cheek junction. Releasing the orbicularis retaining ligament is a crucial step in lower blepharoplasty, specifically for patients with an untoward infraorbital hollow.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe information gathered indicates that lower blepharoplasty is a complex procedure aimed at rejuvenating the lower eyelid area by addressing issues like excess skin, bags, and wrinkles. The focus is on a conservative approach to skin excision and fat repositioning rather than just removal. This suggests that options promoting conservative and precise interventions might be preferable.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Lower eyelid suspension, a common therapeutic procedure for facial paralysis-induced eyelid retraction, faces challenges due to high recurrence in patients lacking facial muscle function and impedes wider adoption. This research aims to explore the potential effects of restoring orbicularis oculi muscle tension through facial nerve reanimation prior to lower eyelid suspension and to define the indications for lower eyelid suspension.\n",
      "METHODS: The study encompassed 32 individuals with complete facial paralysis, segmented into group A (reanimation group) and group B (non-reanimation group), based on whether the orbicularis oculi muscle's tension was restored through facial nerve reconstruction prior to lower eyelid suspension. Subjective assessments of eyelid closure (the inter-eyelid gap upon gentle closure) and objective methods measures of scleral show (the distance from the pupil's center to the lower eyelid margin, MRD2) were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of long-term effectiveness.\n",

      "Treatment of high-grade lower eyelid deformities with massive skin laxity and retroseptal fat pads can be challenging. Common techniques such as the transconjunctival approach and transcutaneous technique performed through a subciliary incision are associated with increased complication rates. Direct excision of the lower eyelid through an infraorbital incision is an alternative technique that allows safe treatment of dermatochalasis and pigmentation and correction of tear trough deformities, suborbicularis oculi fat, and festoons. This study aimed to determine whether direct transcutaneous blepharoplasty with an infraorbital incision could be indicated for these conditions instead of the established operative methods.  A retrospective study of 21 patients with Fratila grades 9 or 10, Hirmand grade 3, and Barton grade 3 who underwent direct transcutaneous lower eyelid blepharoplasty via an infraorbital incision under local anesthesia was performed. All patients underwent surgery during a 9-year period from January 2010 to December 2018. The follow-up period was 12 months. Results were rated postoperatively using Barton grading.  Of 21 consecutive patients (13 women and 8 men), 18 required retroseptal fat pad removal, 3 had laxity of the skin and orbicularis muscle, and 5 had triangular cheek festoons. Combined lower and upper blepharoplasty was performed for 12 patients. All patients were satisfied with their surgical results and major improvements were observed. Scar quality was considered good by all patients.  Direct transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty of the orbital rim can be indicated for different tear trough deformities, suborb\u001b[0m\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in the medical field, yet the use of botulinum toxin type A has remained uninterrupted. Plastic surgeons must carefully consider the timing of administering botulinum toxin type A to patients who have recovered from COVID-19.\n",
      "METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among patients who had contracted and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 within a month. The survey aimed to investigate various indicators in patients who had received botulinum toxin A injections at the same site before and after their infection, including pain scores and allergic reactions and the occurrence of complications.\n",
      "RESULTS: The pain scores of patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection between 14-21 days post-infection exhibited significant variation from previous injections. However, patients who contracted the infection between 22-28 days post-infection did not exhibit significant variation from previous injections. Furthermore, the incidence of allergic reactions and complications following botulinum toxin injection within one month after contracting the infection did not significantly differ from that observed prior to infection.\n",

The ATD group was further divided into subgroups depending on the medication administered: acetylsalicylic acid, ADP receptor antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants, vitamin-K antagonists, or dual antiplatelet therapy. The frequency of hemorrhagic side effects was recorded by retrospective analysis of past treatments as documented in the patient's file set in relation to the number of past treatments (hematoma frequency of past treatments, HF) as well as by a prospective survey capturing the side effects of one single treatment (hematoma frequency of actual treatment, HF). There was no significant difference in hematoma frequency between the ATD group and the control group, neither for past (HF: ATD: 2%; 45/2554; control: 4%; 109/2744) nor for the current BoNT/A treatments (HF: ATD: 30%; 16/53; control: 31%; 22/72).

Abstract. Long-standing facial palsy sequelae cause functional, aesthetic, and psychological problems in patients. Botulinum toxin is an effective way to manage them, but no standardized recommendations exist. Through this non-systematic review, we aimed to guide any practitioner willing to master the ins and outs of this activity. 1. Introduction. Peripheral facial palsy (PFP) is a relatively frequent condition that is caused by various etiologies [].The main causes are Bell's palsy (60-80% of cases), post-traumatic facial palsy, neoplasms, or Zoster infections [2,3].Although facial palsy is recovered from completely in most cases, sequelae can persist in 20 to 30% of cases []. Chronic paralysis of the facial nerve leads to degenerative facial muscle and surrounding soft tissue alterations on the involved side, making the affected patients seem older than their actual age. Moreover, contralateral facial hypertrophy worsens facial asymmetry.

      "Summary::\n",
      "The conjunctiva covers the largest area of ocular surface and is responsible for tear balance and clear vision. After trauma or surgery, the conjunctiva is prone to scarring and contracture. Transplantation with suture often implies numerous complications, such as inflammation, suture erosion, granuloma. And the suture needs to be removed, which means a secondary trauma. In this study, a bioadhesive hydrogel (GMO) for sutureless conjunctival transplantation was developed based on a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (sIPN) consisting of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA). The maximum adhesion strength was 157 ± 17 kPa, and the burst pressure was 357 ± 29 kPa, which was 15 times higher than the human intraocular pressure (IOP). GMO bioadhesive hydrogel significantly improved surgical efficiency and secured the collagen scaffold firmly to a rabbit conjunctival defect. The sutureless transplantation approach revealed the promoted tissue repair without scar. In conclusion, GMO bioadhesive may be an attractive alternative to suture for ocular surface reconstruction by avoiding suture-related complications and improving clinical outcome. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Conjunctival tissue is prone to scarring and contracture after trauma, and surgery with sutures often implies numerous complications. In this study, the ocular surface reconstruction was achieved by sutureless transplantation of conjunctival scaffold using bioadhesive hydrogel. The prepared GMO bioadhesive based on the semi-interpenetrating network of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) had favorable adhesion and mechanical properties.

      "Summary::\n",
      "Labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) is one of the specific diagnostic criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). In traditional LSGB, there is no lower lip fixation device, the field of view is unclear due to intraoperative bleeding, and the incision is large, which is unfavourable for healing. The use of auxiliary devices to improve the shortcomings of traditional LSGB technique would be meaningful. Therefore, this case-control study aimed to assess the value of modified LSGB using chalazion forceps as compared with traditional LSGB. After obtaining written informed consent from all participating parents and patients, we randomly assigned 217 eligible participants to undergo LSGB using chalazion forceps (n = 125) or traditional LSGB (n = 92). The outcome variables were surgical time, incision length, intraoperative bleeding, pain score at 24 h after surgery, incision healing status at 7 days after surgery, gland collection, and pathological results. The final diagnostic results of the two surgical methods were compared, and the match rates between the pathological results and the final clinical diagnoses were compared between the two groups. The data were analysed using parametric and nonparametric tests. Compared with the traditional group, the modified group had a smaller incision, shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower 24 h pain score, and better Grade A incision healing at 7 days after surgery (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the patients in the two surgical-method groups in terms of the positive biopsy results and the final diagnosis based on expert opinions (p > 0.05).

      "Summary::\n",
      "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma (PCMC) is a rare low-grade malignant neoplasm derived from the sweat glands. Local recurrence of PCMC occurs frequently, but these lesions rarely metastasize. Due to the absence of classical demographic and clinical characteristics, PCMCs masquerade as sebaceous cyst, lipoma, pilomatrixoma, chalazion, or squamous cell carcinoma. This misdiagnosis frequently leads to incomplete surgical excision which necessitates further surgical therapy for a curative intent.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of PCMC in a 45-year-old woman which presented as a slow- growing and symptomless nodule in the scalp. After clinical evaluation, the patient had a typical surgical excision for a benign-looking lesion. Histological evaluation of the specimen confirmed a localized PCMC in the scalp with involved surgical margins.\n",
      "CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A thorough oncological assessment by PET-CT scan and radionuclide scintigraphy was performed. Later, a wide local excision using a gamma probe for intra-operative radionuclide localization of the tumor area and sentinel lymph nodes was done.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The patient did not have any regional or distant metastases and remained stable at the time of reporting this case.\n",

It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures. During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal tumors, bleeding and cysts in the brain that might cause a seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. An MRI shows the structure of the brain. After the tonic-clonic seizure is over, the following steps should be taken: lay the patient on his/her side and let him/her rest for a few minutes; if the seizure occurs in a crowded place, ask everyone to move away to ensure the psychological comfort of the affected person; be tactful and ask others to do the same. Aural Phase. The first stage of a seizure, an aura, is also described as the pre-ictal phase. This stage occurs immediately before the ictal stage of a seizure and it can last from a few seconds to an hour in duration. Most people are aware of their own symptoms during a seizure aura. You may or may not have an aura prior to your seizures. Seizures are often placed into subcategories based on what kinds of effects they have on your body. Tonic-clonic: Muscles suddenly become stiff. Atonic: Sudden loss of muscle strength and/or tone. Myoclonic: Short or jerking movements in your muscles.

Endoscopy has risen as a safe and effective minimally invasive tool to optimize microvascular decompression. Endoscopy offers improved visualization, minimizes retraction, and allows for smaller surgical openings compared to traditional microscopic approaches. There are several reports of improved neuralgia outcomes and reduced post-operative complications after endoscopic microvascular decompression. In skilled surgical hands, endoscopy is an excellent option for microvascular decompression as stand-alone tool or adjunct to the microscope.

Fig. 1. Image A represents measuring palpebral aperture. In this instance, the palpebral aperture is 10mm. This elevates the eyelid margin while maintaining a stable palpebral fissure height. The levator switch addresses ptosis from poor levator function and minimizes postoperative corneal exposure. It offers advantages over the existing tarsal switch procedure by preserving the tarsus and meibomian glands, thus maintaining eyelid stability and contour. Levator palpebrae superioris has a static tone that is in balance of the opposing tone of orbicularis oculi, thereby maintaining the eyes open and defining the size of palpebral fissure. Being innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, superior tarsal muscle elevates the eyelid in states of a \"flight or fight\" response. Notable ptosis was observed in the right upper eyelid (Fig. 2 a), with the margin to reflex distance 1 of 1.0 mm on the right and 3.0 mm on the left. The retraction of the right upper eyelid when smiling was approximately 5 mm; thus, it indicates medium retraction. The levator palpebrae superioris is a triangular muscle that elevates and retracts the upper eyelid (see Image. Orbital Muscles). This muscle has an abundant blood supply mainly provided by the ophthalmic and supraorbital arteries, both emanating from the internal carotid artery.

When these muscles are not functioning properly, it can result in a droopy, or ptotic eyelid. The ... Summary Ptosis, or blepharoptosis, refers to the drooping or downward displacement of the upper eyelid. The levator muscle, its aponeurosis, and the superior tarsal muscle are responsible for upper eyelid resting position and elevation.

Although multiple etiological factors are known, lacrimal duct obstruction is a final common pathway following inflammation and fibrosis. Recanalizing the obstructed lacrimal pathways is gaining more ground as an alternative to bypass procedures [1-5]. The lacrimal sac is a vertical fluid reservoir, oriented obliquely inferiorly and posteriorly, directly inferior to the medial canthus. Its vertical length measures an average of 12-14 mm, 4-9 mm antero-posteriorly with a diameter of 3 mm when empty and 8 mm or more when full. Its capacity is between 20 and 120 mm 3.\u001b[0m\n",

The first attempts to reopen the lacrimal system obstruction using a laser ('canaliculoplasty'), were made with a holmium-YAG laser [].After the introduction of transcanalicular endoscopes [], recanalisation of the LDS under endoscopic guidance became possible, and the procedure was named 'laser dacryoplasty' [14, 15]. Abstract. In humans, the lacrimal gland is located in the socket of the frontal bone above the outer orbital area. As an essential part of the eye surface, the gland is fixed to the orbital periosteum by connective tissue. The lacrimal gland passes through the outer tendon membrane, which divides the gland into larger orbital and minor eyelid ... The lacrimal apparatus consists of the lacrimal gland, which secretes the aqueous layer of the tear film, the lacrimal sac, into which the tears drain, and the nasolacrimal duct, through which the tears drain into the nose. Inflammation of the lacrimal gland is called dacryoadenitis and is commonly caused by viral or bacterial infections. Dacryostenosis is an acquired or congenital condition resulting from nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), which causes epiphora or watery eyes. The term \"dacryostenosis\" is derived from the Greek words dákryon (\"tear\") and stenósis (\"narrowing\"), which refers to the congenital or acquired narrowing of the nasolacrimal duct. The ocular surface remains consistently moistened by tears produced ... Operative Treatment. Lacrimal duct probing: ... followed by a detailed discussion of the patient's level of obstruction.

The punctum may either become narrowed or occluded alone (punctal stenosis, PS), in combination with canalicular stenosis (puncto-canalicular stenosis, PCS), in association with a distal lacrimal system obstruction (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, NLDO), or in association with eyelid conditions like horizontal lid laxity (HLL), entropion or ... Menstrual hormonal changes, osteoporosis, and the gradual narrowing of the lacrimal duct, particularly in females older than 40, contribute to increased susceptibility.

      "Primary lacrimal sac lymphoma is a rare condition, often presenting with nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Herein, we present a unique case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) involving the lacrimal sac, maxillary sinus, and infraorbital nerve. Prompt diagnosis via biopsy is essential for timely treatment and the prevention of tumor progression. A 66-year-old female presented with intractable epiphora, infraorbital nerve hypesthesia, and medial canthal swelling. Imaging revealed a soft tissue mass in the right maxillary sinus extending into the right inferior orbit and nasal cavity. A biopsy confirmed DLBCL, prompting systemic chemotherapy. Residual disease prompted high-dose involved-site radiation, resulting in tumor regression. To our knowledge, this is the first case of primary DLBCL of the lacrimal sac with concurrent involvement of the maxillary sinus and infraorbital nerve. This case underscores the significance of lacrimal sac biopsy in refractory dacryocystitis or unilateral sinus disease and the effectiveness of multimodal treatment approaches in managing DLBCL.\n",

      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Although common in adults, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a rare condition in children with the most common etiology being solitary parathyroid adenoma (PTA). The typical presentation is symptomatic hypercalcemia. Management of PHTP secondary to PTA requires excision of the adenoma.\n",
      "CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old adolescent boy presented because of orbital cellulitis and was noted to have hypercalcemia. Despite this, the patient was curiously asymptomatic. Further investigations yielded an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and a normal urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio making the most likely cause of hypercalcemia PHTP secondary to PTA. Imaging demonstrated PTA. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy with the pathology demonstrating PTA. Postoperatively, the PTH levels were undetectable; hence, the patient was treated with calcitriol and calcium supplementation for 1 month and 4 months, respectively. Genetic work-up for multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 and rearranged during transfection mutations was negative.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Solitary PTA is the most common cause of PHPT. Adenomas are mostly sporadic or may be a manifestation of an inheritable syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia. Although symptomatic disease is more common in children, our patient denied any hypercalcemia symptoms. The distinguishing biochemical feature of PHPT because of PTA is high or inappropriately normal PTH level in the context of high-normal or elevated serum calcium levels. Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high. PTAs are localized by ultrasound and Tc-99m-Sestamibi scintigraphy. Management includes parathyroidectomy and monitoring for postoperative hypocalcemia.\n",

      "Odontogenic maxillary sinusitis (OMS) is an infectious inflammatory pathology caused by a dental condition. Considering the anatomical relations with the orbit, maxillary sinus infection can easily spread, evolving into severe oculo-orbital complications that can sometimes be life-threatening.  We performed a retrospective study of over 2 years, examining the data of 18 patients diagnosed with OMS with oculo-orbital complications. The patients were evaluated regarding their dental history, symptoms, clinical and endoscopic findings, ophthalmologic evaluation, bacteriologic tests, computed tomography (CT) imaging, medical and surgical treatment, and outcomes.  The age of the patients was between 24 and 65 years old with an almost equal gender distribution: 10 female and 8 male patients. From the total, 7 patients had type II diabetes, 2 of whom were insulin-dependent, 1 patient had thrombophilia and 2 patients had renal failure with peritoneal dialysis. Regarding the type of oculo-orbital complications, 10 patients were diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and 8 with orbital cellulitis. Just 5 patients with orbital cellulitis required surgical treatment and orbitotomy was performed, followed by endonasal endoscopic drainage. The evolution after surgical treatment was favorable for all operated patients.  Oculo-orbital complications of OMS are typically more severe than those of rhinogenic sinusitis because anaerobic bacteria are involved. Immunosuppression represents a favorable environment for the development of OMS and its complications, diabetes being the most common risk factor.

      "INTRODUCTION: Azathioprine (AZA) interferes with the activation of T and B lymphocytes, which are the main cells involved in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease (GD). The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of AZA as an adjuvant therapy to antithyroid drugs (ATDs) for moderate and severe GD. In addition, we conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of AZA to determine its cost-effectiveness.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, and parallel-group clinical trial. We randomized untreated hyperthyroid patients with severe GD into three groups. All patients received 45-mg carbimazole (CM) as the starting dose and propranolol 40-120 mg daily. The first group (AZA1) received an additional 1 mg/kg/day AZA, the second group (AZA2) received an additional 2 mg/kg/day AZA, and the third group (control group) received only CM and propranolol. We measured thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) levels at baseline and every 3 months, while free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured at the time of diagnosis, 1 month after initiation of therapy, and every 3 months thereafter until 2 years after remission. Thyroid volume (TV) was assessed by ultrasound at baseline and 1 year after remission.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 270 patients were included in this trial. By the end of follow-up, there was higher remission rate in the AZA1 and AZA2 groups compared with controls (87.5% and 87.5% . 33.4%,  = 0.002). Throughout the course of follow-up, FT3, FT4, TSH, and TRAb were significantly different between the AZA groups and the control group, but there was no significant difference regarding TV. The decline in the concentrations of FT4, FT3, and TRAb was sign\u001b[0m\n",

      "Cutaneous pyogenic granulomas (PGs) are common, benign vascular tumors of uncertain pathogenesis; however, a growing body of literature suggests that the formation of PGs may be secondary to genetic alterations in both the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. We present three cases of spontaneous multifocal PGs that first presented in infancy, were not associated with other vascular anomalies or discernable etiology, harbored somatic genetic variants in the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (NRAS n = 2, FGFR1 n = 1), were refractory to treatment with beta-blockers and mTOR inhibitors, and responded best to pulsed dye laser.

      "Summary::\n",
      "We previously described the first successful treatment of deep periocular and, subsequently, orbital infantile haemangiomas (IH) with topical transcutaneous timolol maleate 0.5% (TM 0.5%) alone as the first-line treatment in the acute proliferative phase in infancy. It is not known whether orbital IH with persistent proptosis in later years, untreated in infancy, would still respond to TM 0.5% treatment as well. To our best knowledge, we here present the first reports of the successful late treatment of persistent orbital IH with topical timolol maleate 0.5% applied to the skin overlying the orbital IH in two teenagers. Case 1 was an 11-year-old girl with proptosis measuring 4 mm before and 7 mm after Valsalva manoeuvre that diminished to 1 mm after topical treatment. Case 2 was a 10-year-old girl with 2 mm (before) and 4 mm proptosis (after Valsalva) that decreased to 0 mm proptosis with topical treatment. The time to resolution was 19 months (case 1) and 13 months (case 2). The treatment dose was 3 drops of TM 0.5% applied an average of 1.94 (case 1) and two times daily (case 2). In comparison to proptosis, resolution of periorbital swelling required less treatment time. There was no recurrence of either proptosis or periorbital swelling 1 year after stopping treatment in either case. The findings indicate that beta-blockers are effective not just in the proliferative but also in the late involutional phase in older children. No adverse clinical effects were noted throughout treatment in either case. The presence of increased proptosis with a Valsalva manoeuvre predicts a significant persistent vascular compartment in the orbital IH and may thus serve as a simple predictive clinical sign of likely treatment success.

Silent sinus syndrome (SSS), first described by Montgomery in 1964 , is characterized by the spontaneous collapse of the maxillary sinus walls, resulting in the descent of the orbital floor. Clinical presentation typically includes painless progressive enophthalmos, hypoglobus, diplopia, orbital asymmetry, diminished malar projection, and ... Over time, the absorption of secretions leads to negative pressure in the sinus and the shrinking of its walls. The downward displacement of the orbital floor and its lack of support lead to hypoglobus and enophthalmos.

Silent sinus syndrome (SSS), also known as imploding maxillary antrum syndrome, involves the asymptomatic and spontaneous collapse of maxillary sinus walls and floor of the orbit [].]. This is a relatively rare condition exhibiting progressive enophthalmos as a result of maxillary sinus atelectasis and retraction resulting in orbital expansion and weakening of the orbital floor.

      "A 37-year-old scuba diver developed sudden severe headache, mid-facial pressure/pain and diplopia while diving. Upon examination, he had signs and symptoms consistent with silent sinus syndrome (SSS), including bilateral enophthalmos, hypoglobus, and diplopia/strabismus in conjunction with CT findings of occluded maxillary sinus ostia, atrophic/collapsed maxillary sinuses, and bilateral orbital floor fractures with fat herniation. As there was no history of trauma or chronic sinusitis, this rare case of bilateral SSS was deemed the cause of the spontaneous fractures (i.e. barotrauma secondary to a lack of equalization to ambient surrounding pressure). Transconjunctival repair of the fractures was successful and maxillary sinus antrostomies re-established aeration of the sinuses. We present this case and its management, as well as review the literature concerning sinus barotrauma as a result of diving and SSS.

Ideal for understanding this advanced vision correction option. The light adjustable lens (LAL) is a breakthrough technology that offers a unique advantage over traditional intraocular lenses. With LAL, our eye surgeon has the ability to adjust the lens power after it has been implanted in your eye. This means that your vision can be fine-tuned to achieve optimal clarity and focus. LAL implants, on the other hand, offer a higher level of accuracy in lens power adjustment. The Light Delivery Device, which adjusts the power of an LAL implant, can adjust lens prescriptions at the lowest levels, such as -0.25 of shere or astigmatic correction.The process of fine-tuning the lens power using UV light ensures precise correction, resulting in optimal visual acuity.\u001b[0m\n",

Units included are LogMar, Snellen (20 ft), Snellen (6 m), Visual Acuity Rating, and Decimal acuity. Download the PDF and print it to reference in your practice. Most vision testing in the United States uses the Snellen chart, which requires a test distance of 20 feet. In other countries, visual acuity is expressed using the metric system. Because 20 feet is equivalent to 6.096 meters, 20/20 vision is equal to 6/6 vision. For example, 6/12 is a metric measurement on the Snellen test. Calculate diopters for various lens types. Facilitate eye care professionals in prescribing lenses. Assist students and educators in optical studies. Practical Examples of Diopter Calculations For instance, if the focal length (x) is 0.5 meters, the diopter value (D) is calculated as the reciprocal, D = 1/0.5, which results in D = 2 diopters. The relationship between a lens' focal length and its diopter strength is somewhat inversely proportional. For example, if your lens' diopter is 2, the focal length will be ½ m. If it's 3 or 4, it's going to be ⅓ or ¼ m, respectively. But a focal length of 1 m is just the same as a 1 diopter lens.\u001b[0m\n",

With this guide, you now have a complete understanding of what prism means, how it's measured, types of prism, when it's prescribed, and what to expect with prism lenses. Prism lenses, unlike typical lenses, have a unique, wedge-like shape that enables them to refract, or bend, light. This refraction process is the key to prism correction, a method used to rectify various forms of visual misalignment. By bending the light before it enters the eye, the image alignment happens before it reaches the retina. The spherical equivalent is a valuable concept in vision correction, simplifying the understanding and prescription of refractive errors. By combining the values of sphere and cylinder prescriptions, the spherical equivalent helps determine the appropriate corrective measures, whether it's through glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. The Role of SPH in Vision Correction Correcting your vision primarily involves bending light rays with corrective lenses so that they focus properly on your retina. And that's where the SPH in your prescription comes in. It's the key to figuring out how much correction you need. What Are the Elements in a Glass Prescription?

Magnification in reading glasses is measured in diopters, which indicate the degree of thickness in the lens that corrects your vision.

      "The burden of avoidable blindness from corneal disease is significantly higher where access to specialist eye care, the cost of treatment and the treatment infrastructure including eye banking, are beyond the reach of the impoverished masses. Corneal transplantation in children is challenging: it is more technically complex; patients often require multiple examinations under general anaesthesia to optimize treatment outcomes. There is also the increased risk of several complications including graft dehiscence, infection, rejection, and inappropriate patient or caregiver care. However, when successful, it restores vision. We present a report of our initial experience with penetrating keratoplasty in 2 children with blinding corneal disease in Uyo, Nigeria. Corneal transplantation history was retrieved and data (including data on age, sex, aetiology of corneal disease, indications for corneal transplantation, pre-operative and post-operative visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements) was extracted for this report. Both patients had standard penetrating keratoplasty performed by one surgeon, under general anaesthesia. Case one was a 10-year-old male presenting with profound visual impairment from congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy. His best corrected post-operative visual acuity was 6/24. Case two was a 3-year-old male with vision loss due to a corneal leucoma following treated herpes simplex keratitis. Post-operatively, his best corrected visual acuity improved to 6/12. Corneal graft tissue remained clear at more than 3 years of follow-up. Although amblyopia was a notable co-morbidity, corneal transplantation significantly improved their vision.

      "The burden of avoidable blindness from corneal disease is significantly higher where access to specialist eye care, the cost of treatment and the treatment infrastructure including eye banking, are beyond the reach of the impoverished masses. Corneal transplantation in children is challenging: it is more technically complex; patients often require multiple examinations under general anaesthesia to optimize treatment outcomes. There is also the increased risk of several complications including graft dehiscence, infection, rejection, and inappropriate patient or caregiver care. However, when successful, it restores vision. We present a report of our initial experience with penetrating keratoplasty in 2 children with blinding corneal disease in Uyo, Nigeria. Corneal transplantation history was retrieved and data (including data on age, sex, aetiology of corneal disease, indications for corneal transplantation, pre-operative and post-operative visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements) was extracted for this report. Both patients had standard penetrating keratoplasty performed by one surgeon, under general anaesthesia. Case one was a 10-year-old male presenting with profound visual impairment from congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy. His best corrected post-operative visual acuity was 6/24. Case two was a 3-year-old male with vision loss due to a corneal leucoma following treated herpes simplex keratitis. Post-operatively, his best corrected visual acuity improved to 6/12. Corneal graft tissue remained clear at more than 3 years of follow-up. Although amblyopia was a notable co-morbidity, corneal transplantation significantly improved their vision.

Therapeutic and optical penetrating keratoplasty are the most commonly performed transplants in children. Different surgical approaches may apply, and also a variety of suturing techniques can be used by corneal surgeons in PKP. These are mainly interrupted stitches, single-running sutures, double-running sutures and combined interrupted stitches with running sutures. Running sutures can be torque or anti-torque. Abstract We have provided a high-level overview that addresses two fundamental causes of early and late graft rejection (immunological rejection and endothelial cell failure) in the first section, as well as the short-term and long-term functional and refractive results of penetrating keratoplasty in the second. This review explores contemporary challenges in penetrating keratoplasty (PK), focusing on technical intricacies, technological advancements, and strategies for preventing graft rejection. The management of an episode of corneal graft rejection (CGR) is primarily by corticosteroids. Immunomodulators are useful for long-term immunosuppression and in dealing with cases of high-risk (HR) corneal grafts.

      "Summary::\n",
      "Vestibular schwannomas (VSs), also called acoustic neuromas, are benign intracranial neoplasms of the vestibulocochlear (VIII) cranial nerve. Management options include \"wait-and-scan,\" stereotactic radiosurgery and surgical resection. Due to the proximity of the VIII nerve to the facial (VII) nerve in the cerebello-pontine angle, the VII nerve is particularly vulnerable to the effects of surgical resection. This can result in poor eye closure, lagophthalmos and resultant corneal exposure post VS resection. Additionally, compression from the tumor or resection can cause trigeminal (V) nerve damage and a desensate cornea. The combination of an exposed and desensate cornea puts the eye at risk of serious ocular complications including persistent epithelial defects, corneal ulceration, corneal vascularization, corneal melting and potential perforation. The abducens (VI) nerve can be affected by a large intracranial VS causing raised intracranial pressure (a false localizing sign) or as a result of damage to the VI nerve at the time of resection. Other types of neurogenic strabismus are rare and typically transient. Contralaterally beating nystagmus as a consequence of vestibular dysfunction is common post-operatively. This generally settles to pre-operative levels as central compensation occurs. Ipsilaterally beating nystagmus post-operatively should prompt investigation for post-operative cerebrovascular complications. Papilledema (and subsequent optic atrophy) can occur as a result of a large VS causing raised intracranial pressure. Where papilledema follows surgical resection of a VS, it can indicate that cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has occurred. Poor visual function following VS resection can result as a combination of all these potential complications and is more likely with larger tumors.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To describe three anterior segment dysgenesis disorders with infantile corneal opacities, namely, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED), primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), and Peters anomaly (PA) in terms of clinical characteristics, histopathology, genetic association, and diagnostic imaging profiles using imaging modalities such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and microscope-integrated intraoperative optical coherence tomography (i-OCT).\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four eyes with 22 eyes of CHED, 28 eyes of PA, and 24 eyes of PCG were clinically evaluated and underwent imaging using UBM and i-OCT. Corneal buttons of 16 operated patients underwent histopathological analysis, while genetic analysis was done in 23 patients using whole-exome sequencing.\n",
      "RESULTS: Corneal diameters (CD) and UBM parameters like anterior chamber depth (ACD), iris thickness (IT), and ciliary body (CB) thickness revealed a statistically significant difference between the three categories. In PA, 9 eyes had a third rare phenotype with only a posterior corneal defect with no iris adhesions. Genetic mutations were seen in all tested patients with CHED, in 83.3% of patients with PCG, and in 80% of patients with the third type of PA. i-OCT helped in the characterization of corneal opacity, identification of posterior corneal defects, iridocorneal adhesions, and contour of Descemet's membrane.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Overlapping phenotypes of the above disorders cause a diagnostic dilemma and parameters like CDs, UBM ACD, IT, and CB thickness help differentiate between them. i-OCT can help in classifying the diseases in a high resolution, non-contact manner, and can better delineate corneal characteristics.

Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a rare genetic corneal disorder causing progressive cornea clouding and significant visual impairment. CHED remains a leading indication for pediatric corneal transplantation despite its infrequency, particularly in regions with high consanguinity rates like Southeast Asia.

      "PURPOSE: To establish an animal model of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) using Slc4a11 knockout (KO) mice and evaluate the abnormalities in the cornea and kidney.\n",
      "METHODS: The Slc4a11 KO mouse model was generated by gene deletion. Corneal abnormalities were evaluated using slit-lamp photography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, corneal endothelial cell staining, and electron microscopy. The temporal corneal changes were also monitored. Histological and functional changes of the kidney were also evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Successful knockout of the Slc4a11 gene was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Slit-lamp photography and AS-OCT showed progressive corneal edema. Increased corneal endothelial cell size with decreased corneal endothelial cell density was observed with increased age. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed progressive cell swelling and distortion of the hexagonal cell morphology with time. Transmission electron microscopy showed characteristic ultrastructural findings of CHED, including endothelial vacuolization, thickening of the Descemet membrane, disorganization of collagen fibril, deposition of amorphous material, and progression of these changes with age. Decreased urine osmolarity and electrolyte concentrations suggesting abnormality in water resorption were also detected.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To present the clinical, genetic, and histopathological features of the ninth family affected by congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD) to date.\n",
      "METHODS: Twelve cases of a Spanish family affected by CSCD were analyzed regarding history, visual acuity (VA, decimal scale), an ophthalmologic exam and specular microscopy. Five eyes were treated by deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), and thirteen eyes by penetrating keratoplasty (PK). In the two last generations, a genetic study was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Most of the patients affected were born with opaque corneas except for three, whose corneas were clear at birth. Biomicroscopy showed a whitish diffuse stromal opacity with an unaltered epithelium, causing poor VA (from hand motions to 0.4). Patients treated with PK presented mean postoperative VA of 0.19±0.20 over a follow-up time of 235.3±101.4months with 38% recurrences. Patients who underwent DALK experienced VA improvement to 0.17±0.11 over a follow-up time of 10.8±2.6months without signs of recurrence. In the latter, the big bubble technique was not achieved, so a manual technique was performed. The genetic study showed heterozygosis for a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 962 in exon 8 of the decorin gene.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: CSCD is a rare entity, which should be treated by DALK whenever possible, obtaining better results than PK. Close monitoring of children of affected individuals is important, because CSCD can progress during the early years of life.\n",

Common features include pronounced itching, a milky conjunctival appearance, a stringy or ropy discharge and papillary hypertrophy of the tarsal conjunctiva in severe cases, and a family history of allergy. The diagnosis should be based on thorough history-taking and careful ophthalmic examination, and, when necessary, confirmation by laboratory testing. An IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity mechanism is associated with most types of allergic conjunctivitis, although contact allergy is mediated by lymphocytes rather than antibody. Treatment is based on the diagnosis and severity of signs and symptoms.

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a chronic, allergic ocular disease that occurs most often in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis (AD). Although less common than other forms of ocular allergy, AKC can cause severe damage to the ocular surface, leading to corneal scarring and vision loss if not treated properly. Allergic conjunctivitis is a common, under-appreciated, and largely benign condition.[1] Allergic conjunctivitis prevalence has increased over the past decade, making it one of clinical practice's most frequently encountered conditions.

      "The clinical course of adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis is mostly self-limiting and requires only supportive management measures; however, a minority of patients may develop severe inflammation in response to the virus, which can present as subepithelial infiltrates and pseudomembranes.

The optimal management of adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis is poorly defined and while debridement is commonly recommended, there is limited evidence base to support this practice.

      "Summary::\n",
      "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, also known as herpes zoster is common in older adults and immunocompromised individuals and often causes a painful, vesicular rash limited to a dermatomal distribution. On occasion, it can lead to various neurological complications as well. Here we present the case of a young, immunocompetent male in his 20's with a history of primary varicella infection who presented with complaints of a painful rash in the S3-S4 dermatomal distribution. Despite being initiated on the standard oral antiviral dose for two days, he developed a headache and neck stiffness. He was diagnosed with VZV meningitis through the lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay analysis. The patient reported significant improvement in symptoms following intravenous acyclovir and was discharged with additional oral valacyclovir at a higher-than-standard dosage. Our case highlights that even in relatively low-risk patients, physicians must maintain a high level of clinical suspicion for the complications of VZV reactivation even after beginning the oral antiviral medication.\n",

      "METHODS: Data of randomized controlled Trials (RCTS) were obtained from the databases of both English (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science Journal Database, and WanFang Database) literatures from inception to 12 September 2022. Meta-analyses of efficacy and safety of Brivudine for the treatment of herpes zoster for RCTS were conducted.\n",
      "RESULTS: The analyses included seven RCTS (2095 patients in experimental group and 2076 patients in control group) in the treatment of HZ with brivudine. It suggested that the brivudine group was superior to the control group in terms of efficacy ( = .0002) and incidence of postherpetic neuralgia ( = .04). But the incidence of adverse reactions has no significant difference between the brivudine and the control groups ( = .22). In addition, subgroup analysis of adverse events also showed that brivudine was about the same safety as other modalities in the treatment of HZ ( > .05).\n",

Dryness can lead to fluctuations in the tear film covering your eyes, which causes light to scatter and vision to blur. This can make activities like driving, reading, or working at a computer difficult. Lasik surgery involves reshaping the cornea, which is the clear front part of the eye. However, this procedure can also have an impact on the retina, which is located at the back of the eye. The creation of a corneal flap during Lasik surgery can disrupt the normal anatomy of the eye and potentially increase the risk of retinal detachment. The risk of a new retinal break or detachment following cataract surgery in eyes that had undergone repair of phakic break or detachment: a hypothesis of a causal relationship to cataract surgery. Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society. 2003; 101 : 335 Smoking after LASIK surgery can significantly increase the risk of developing infections in the eyes. Smoking weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off bacteria and viruses. This can increase the likelihood of developing infections in the eyes, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to long-term complications. Like all surgeries, LASIK (laser eye surgery for vision correction) has risks. Research has shown that serious complications are rare and that the majority of patients are happy with the results. But anyone considering elective surgery should get the facts from their ophthalmologist about risks, outcomes and realistic expectations..

      "Keratitis is a corneal infection caused by various bacteria and fungi. Eye drop treatment of keratitis involves significant challenges due to difficulties in administration, inefficiencies in therapeutic dosage, and frequency of drug applications. All these are troublesome and result in unsuccessful treatment, high cost, time loss, development of drug resistance by microorganisms, and a massive burden on human health and the healthcare system. Most of the antibacterial and antifungal medications are non-water-soluble and/or include toxic drug formulations. Here, the aim was to develop drug-loaded contact lenses with therapeutic dosage formulations and extended drug release capability as an alternative to eye drops, by employing supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO) as a drug impregnation solvent to overcome inefficient ophthalmic drug use. ScCO, known as a green solvent, has very low viscosity which provides high mass transfer power and could enhance drug penetration into contact lenses much better with respect to drug loading using other solvents. Here, moxifloxacin (MOX) antibiotic and amphotericin B (AMB) antifungal medicines were separately loaded into commercially available silicone hydrogel contact lenses through 1) drug adsorption from the aqueous solutions and 2) impregnation techniques via ScCO and their efficacies were compared. Drug impregnation parameters, i.e., 8-25 MPa pressure, 310-320 K temperature, 2-16-hour impregnation times, and the presence of ethanol as polar co-solvent were investigated for the optimization of the ScCO drug impregnation process. The highest drug loading and long-term release kinetic from the contact lenses were obtained at 25 MPa and 313 K with 2.5 h impreg\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "The objective of this study was to investigate the culture positivity and distribution of the conjunctival sac bacteria in the perioperative period of corneal refractive surgery. The selected time points of the perioperative period included before the use of antibiotic eye drops, before eye wash (after the use of antibiotic eye drops), after eye wash, and immediately after surgery. Conjunctival specimens obtained at the four time points were cultured to detect the positivity and distribution of bacteria. Before prophylactic antibiotic eye drops were administered, 49 eyes (50%) had positive bacterial culture results, with 45 isolates (91.8%) identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. The culture positivity rates of the conjunctival sac specimens before eye wash, after eye wash, and immediately after surgery were 19.4%, 3.1%, and 4.1%, respectively. The difference was significant before and after the use of antibiotics and before and after eye wash (both P < 0.001). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the major pathogen in the conjunctival sac before corneal refractive surgery, and the culture positivity rate of the conjunctival bacteria was higher in males. Sixteen of 37 eyes (43.2%) with contact lenses had positive culture results, compared to 33 of 61 eyes (54.1%) without contact lenses (P > 0.05). The judicious preoperative use of antibiotic eye drops combined with the surgical sterile eye wash procedure maximised the removal of conjunctival sac bacteria. Skilled surgical manipulations generally did not increase the risk of infection.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Neurotrophic keratopathy is a rare disorder caused by the loss of corneal sensation. It is characterized by persistent epithelial defects, corneal ulceration, and, ultimately, corneal perforation if not managed in a timely manner. The management includes aggressive lubrication, prophylactic topical antibiotics, therapeutic contact lenses, tarsorrhaphy, and amniotic membrane transplantation. Some novel therapeutic options are also available, one of which is topical insulin therapy. We report the clinical course of a patient with neurotrophic keratopathy that was successfully treated with topical insulin. A 64-year-old male presented to our outpatient department with a three-month history of painless blurring of vision following prior episodes of herpetic keratitis. Ocular examination showed a bilateral reduction in corneal sensations, bilateral corneal opacities, and a corneal ulcer in the left eye. He was diagnosed as a case of neurotrophic keratopathy secondary to prior herpetic keratitis. He was then treated with topical and oral acyclovir along with topical insulin drops. There was a remarkable improvement in his condition after a month with a reduction in the size of the ulcer and, after two months, the ulcer was completely re-epithelialized. This case report illustrates the use of topical insulin in the initial management of neurotrophic keratopathy as opposed to its conventional use in refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers.\n",

Post-refractive intraocular lens power calculation formulas. Most IOL power calculation formulas have satisfactory refractive outcomes for eyes with AL ranging between 22.0 and 25.0 mm [ 10 ]. The accuracy of IOL power calculation formulas for eyes shorter than 22.0 mm and longer than 25.0 mm is less precise [ 11 - 14 ]. Steps in the calculation of IOL power include [ 2 ]: 1. Measuring the corneal power (keratometry) and AL of the eye. 2. Using the appropriate IOL calculation formula. The decision to use emmetropia for distance versus mono vision is discussed with the patient, and IOL power is decided based on these parameters. A combination of best-performing formulas was calculated for the flat K subgroup (Table 5).Many of the combinations of two or three formulas (including DK Holladay 1 and DK SRK/T formulas in addition to the three best performing formulas) yielded good results with approximately 50% and 75 to 80% of the cases within +0.50 D and +1.0 D of intended refraction, respectively.

      "Summary::\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Currently, there is no consensus regarding the management of intermittent exotropia (IXT), which includes both surgical and non-surgical treatment options. Nonsurgical management of IXT has been suggested and includes watchful observation, patching, overminus lenses, prism, and vision therapy/orthoptics. While a significant portion of IXT patients are treated by surgery, it is reported that there is a substantial tendency for reoperation or recurrence of IXT. This paper provides a comprehensive review of non-surgical and surgical treatment options for the IXT.\n",
      "METHODS: Search strategies involving combination of keywords including intermittent exotropia, divergence excess, basic exotropia, refractive error, glasses, spectacles, natural history, untreated, observe, occlusion, patch, overminus, overcorrecting minus, prism, vision therapy, orthoptic, anti-suppression, fusion exercise, and surgery were used in Medline. All English articles from 01/01/1900 to 01/09/2020 were reviewed. The reference list of the identified articles was also checked for additional relevant articles. Studies focused on animal models or strabismus associated with neurologic disorders or injury were excluded. The following filters were used for surgical management due to the abundance of reports: full text, randomized controlled trial, review, in the last 5 years.\n",
      "RESULTS: Appropriate optical correction of refractive error is generally the starting point for all management approaches, but there is a lack of randomized clinical trial data regarding this treatment modality. Randomized clinical trial data indicate that both observation and occlusion are reasonable management options for children 3-10 years old, and there were insufficient data to recommend occlusion for children 12-35\u001b[0m\n",

      "PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of pencil push-up training and binocular vision training in treating post-operative mild under-correction in patients with intermittent exotropia.\n",
      "METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted, including patients who underwent surgery for intermittent exotropia at Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between June 2022 and January 2023 and experienced post-operative mild under-correction (-8∆ to -15∆). Patients were divided into two groups: pencil push-up training group and binocular vision training group. All patients underwent measurements of exodeviation and stereoacuity at distance and near, sensory fusion, and fusion convergence amplitude. The data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and Chi-square tests.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in exodeviation at distance and near between the two training groups before the training. After 6 months of training, the exodeviation at distance and near achieved a significant decrease in both groups (P < 0.05), and the pencil push-up training group showed a similar distance and near exodeviation compared to the binocular vision training group (t = 1.58, P ＞ 0.05; t = 0.43, P ＞ 0.05). After 6 months of training, the binocular vision training group exhibited significantly superior stereoacuity and fusion convergence amplitude compared to the pencil push-up training group (P < 0.001).\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To investigate structural and functional changes of brain in children with intermittent exotropia (IXT) and their relationship with clinical features.\n",
      "METHODS: Twenty-one IXT patients (mean age 9.38 ± 2.62 years) and 21 age-, gender-, education-, and handedness-matched healthy controls (HCs, mean age 9.52 ± 3.28 years) underwent high-resolution T1 imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The gray and white matter volume analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based on T1 imaging, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) indices based on DTI, and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) value based on rs-fMRI were compared between these 2 groups. The correlations between MRI-derived parameters in significant brain regions and various clinical characteristics of IXT were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with HCs, IXT children showed significantly decreased FA in right precentral gyrus (PRG) and right postcentral gyrus (POG), and significantly decreased ALFF in bilateral calcarine sulcus, bilateral cuneus, left lingual gyrus, and left superior occipital gyrus. The FA value in right PRG and right POG was negatively correlated with disease duration (r = -0.520, P = 0.016), angle of exodeviation at near (r = -0.549, P = 0.010), and angle of exodeviation at distance (r = -0.547, P = 0.010).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: IXT children exhibited abnormalities of white matter microstructure and reduced spontaneous neural activities in brain regions involving in oculomotor performance and binocular fusion. Further studies are needed to determine whether these findings are related to the neuropathologic mechanism or downstream changes of IXT.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term safety, effectiveness, and stability of unilateral LASIK in pediatric myopic anisometropic amblyopia.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective study included children who received unilateral LASIK for myopic anisometropia of >6 D, after mandatory 6-month occlusion/penalization therapy. They were evaluated at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and biannually until 10 years. Outcome measures included visual acuity, refraction, ocular alignment, stereopsis, corneal clarity, and corneal topography.\n",
      "RESULTS: 32 patients (16 girls) with mean age of 8.6 ± 2.3 years completed 10 years of follow up after unilateral LASIK. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (SER) was -10.3D ±2.0D in the affected eye, with anisometropic difference of -9.5D ±1.7D. Mean post-LASIK SER was -1.3D±0.8D (p<0.001). Anisometropia significantly decreased to 0.3D±0.8D, 0.4D±1.0D, and 1.0±2.5D at 6 months, 1 year and 10 years respectively (p<0.001). 11 patients (34%) who had preoperative intermittent exotropia (< 15°) regained orthophoria in all gazes, while 5 of 10 who had constant exotropia with large angle (>30°) required strabismus surgery for ocular alignment. BCVA improved from 0.04±0.6 Decimal at baseline to 0.6 ±0.2 after LASIK and occlusion therapy (p< 0.001). Despite insignificant refractive regression in both eyes, patients have maintained orthophoria, improved stereopsis, clear cornea, and the topography showed no evidence of post-LASIK ectasia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: LASIK appears safe, effective, and stable for correcting refractory pediatric myopic anisometropia, in which conventional measures fail or endanger normal visual development. Eliminating anisometropic aniseikonia consequently restores binocular vision and stereopsis which, along with amblyopia therapy, would reverse amblyopia and prevent recurrence.\n",

It gives you the visual capacity to deduce an object in length, width, size, appearance, and distance. Stereoscopic depth perception is how you judge an image against other visible options in your visual field. It is classified into two cues. Stereopsis, also known as stereoscopic depth perception, is the ability of both eyes to see the same object as one image and to create a perception of depth. It is a measure of binocular visual function, i.e. how well both eyes work together. While not as commonly tested for in adults compared to the uniocular visual function tests (such as ...

      "Summary::\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Sensory exotropia is often due to profound amblyopia. Surgery essentially aims to improve aesthetic appearance and quality of life. Our goal was to discuss clinical features of sensory exotropia as well as surgical indications and outcomes.\n",
      "METHODS: Medical records of 43 patients who underwent sensory exotropia surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Each patient had an ophthalmological examination and a complete sensorimotor assessment. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon. We studied the influence of certain prognostic factors on motility outcomes, such as age of onset of strabismus, gender, delay of surgical management, degree of amblyopia, angle of deviation, and amount of recession/resection.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 2.3 years. All of our patients had severe amblyopia. An abnormal retinal correspondence with no fusion or stereopsis was noted in all subjects. The mean angle of deviation was 44.5 PD±12.4 SD preoperatively. The alignment success rate after a single procedure was 65.1%. Eight patients developed recurrent exotropia and were reoperated, with a final alignment success rate of 74.4%.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Sensory exotropia is characterized by a large angle of deviation and an altered sensory status. The overall goal of surgery is to improve the patient's aesthetics and quality of life by treating the maximum angle of deviation. Surgical outcomes are often satisfactory for the patients, but certain complications may occur, such as diplopia, enopthalmos, and recurrences.\n",

      "METHODS: The medical records of children 1-14 years of age treated for PAET with BMR or BTX between 2010 and 2020 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. PAET was defined as residual esotropia of at least 14 after 6 weeks of continuous wear of full cycloplegic refraction (> +2.5 D). Success was defined as esotropia of 0-10 after a single surgery or ≥1 BTX injections.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 224 patients, 121 received BTX and 103 underwent BMR. BMR showed a higher success rate than BTX (70.9% vs 53.7% [P = 0.006]). BMR was more successful in males, in patients >5 years of age, and when spherical equivalent was ≤ +5.00 D (79.2%, 74.3%, and 67.5%, resp. [P < 0.05]). Mean follow-up was shorter in the BMR group than in the BTX group (16.7 ± 14.7 vs 31.4 ± 29.5 months [P = 0.0001]). Mean duration of surgery was significantly shorter in the BTX group (5.2 ± 4.3 vs 70.5 ± 31.4 min [P = 0.0001]). Postoperative inferior oblique overaction was more common in the BTX group (7.4%; P = 0.02 [Fisher exact test]), and persistent ptosis was only seen in the BTX group (0.8%); consecutive exotropia was only seen in the BMR group (2%).\n",

      "PURPOSE: Ventral hernias are a common complication of laparotomy, posing challenges particularly when primary fascial closure is unattainable.

BTX was administered unilaterally, and the traction force required to medially advance the anterior rectus sheath was measured intraoperatively.

Strabismus is a common childhood ocular condition estimated to affect 2% to 4% of children between 6 months and 5 years of age.[1,2,3,4] Exotropia is a manifest outward deviation of eyes seen in 1% to 2% of the pediatric population.[] When untreated, these children are at an increased risk of amblyopia and thus contribute to childhood visual impairment.[] Postoperatively at the final follow-up, there were 45.4% (15 cases) within 10 PD, 24.2% (8 cases) between 11 and 20 PD, 12.1% (4 cases) between 21 and 30 PD, 9% (3 cases) between 31 and 40 PD of ...\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical findings and surgical outcomes of patients with traumatic isolated inferior rectus muscle paresis.\n",
      "METHODS: The medical records of patients with traumatic isolated inferior rectus paresis who underwent strabismus surgery at Farabi Eye Hospital between 2011 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical features, type of surgery, and surgical outcomes were extracted from the record for analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (14 males [74%]) were included. Mean patient age was 34.8 ± 14.6 years. Left eyes in 13 patients (68%) were involved. Thirteen cases (68%) underwent orbital reconstruction surgery for blow-out fracture. Preoperative limitation of duction in the gaze of the inferior rectus muscle was -2 to -3 in all cases. Four patients (21%) had a paradoxical contralateral compensatory head tilt. Inferior rectus muscle resection alone was the first surgical intervention in 12 patients (63%). At the final follow-up, 12 patients (63%) were orthotropic, without any deviation or diplopia in primary position and downgaze. Three patients (16%) had a residual hypertropia of 3 at distance and near without diplopia, and 4 patients (21%) required reoperation.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In our patients with traumatic isolated inferior rectus paresis with persistent deviation at least 6 months after trauma, a stepwise approach based on size of the vertical deviation was employed, with good outcomes: inferior rectus resection alone for hypertropia of 6-20 and inferior rectus resection and superior rectus recession for hypertropia of ≥20 or significant hypertropia in the field of the superior rectus muscle.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is a benign epithelial tumour originating from the salivary gland, specifically the parotid gland. This study aims to comprehensively analyse the clinical and pathological features of PA by examining the characteristics of the tumour, including its histological structure and immunohistochemical profile.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over 8 years, beginning in October 2015 and ending in October 2023, an exhaustive retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal University, Karnataka, India. The research focused on 100 cases of pleomorphic adenoma and involved a meticulous examination of the clinical and pathological characteristics obtained by retrieving the pertinent files.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of all the primary tumours, the majority ( = 70) was found in the parotid gland, followed by PA that developed from the minor salivary glands of the palate ( = 07), the submandibular gland ( = 17), and the lacrimal gland ( = 04). Only two cases had a primary tumour located in the lips. Females were more susceptible to these tumours than males. The parotid gland tumours showed a distinct trend in laterality, with 73 cases observed on the right side. In 85%, the initial symptom of the condition was painless swelling.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Salivary gland PA is typically a benign tumour. However, a subset of these tumours can exhibit a malignant phenotype. The preferred treatment is surgical excision with adequate margins.\n",

      "Myeloid sarcomas (MS) involve extramedullary blast proliferation from one or more myeloid lineages that replace the original tissue architecture, and these neoplasias are called granulocytic sarcomas, chloromas or extramedullary myeloid tumors. Such tumors develop in lymphoid organs, bones (e.g., skulls and orbits), skin, soft tissue, various mucosae, organs, and the central nervous system. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is rare, while the occurrence of myeloid sarcomas in patients without leukemia is even rare. Here, we report a case of a 38-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and progressive jaundice. An upper GI endoscopy had shown extensive multifocal hyperemic fold thickening and the spread of nodular lesions in the body of the stomach. Biopsies from the gastric lesions indicated myeloid sarcoma of the stomach. However, concurrent peripheral blood and bone marrow examinations showed no evidence of acute myeloid leukemia. For diagnosis, the immunohistochemical markers must be checked when evaluating a suspected myeloid sarcoma case. Accurate MS diagnosis determines the appropriate therapy and prognosis.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs), a rare group of neoplasms in the orbit, comprise only 4% of all orbital tumors. At present, there are very few studies detailing the features of these tumors identified using imaging technology.\n",
      "AIM: To compare the differences in location, morphology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity/computed tomography (CT) value, and enhancement degree of tumors of different pathological PNSTs types.\n",
      "METHODS: Clinical, pathological, CT, and MRI data were analyzed retrospectively in 34 patients with periorbital sheath tumors diagnosed using histopathology from January 2013 to August 2021.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 34 cases of orbital peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 21 were schwannomas, 12 were neurofibromas, and 1 was a plexiform neurofibroma. Common clinical symptoms presented by patients with these types of tumors include eyelid swelling, exophthalmos, and limited eye movement. Schwannomas mostly occur in the intramuscular space with small tumor volume and rare bone involvement. Neurofibromas develop in the extrapyramidal space with larger tumor volume and more bone involvement. Radiologically, schwannomas and neurofibromas are characterized by regular morphology and uneven density and signal. One case of plexiform neurofibroma showed tortuous and diffuse growth along the nerve, with a worm-like appearance on imaging.\n",

      "METHODS: Patients diagnosed with either corneal-conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from May 2000 to December 2015, were recruited. The patients' demographics, symptoms, clinical characteristics, cytopathology, treatments, and outcomes were reviewed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall 171 eyes from 168 patients, 92 eyes were CIN and 79 eyes were SCC. Males were affected in 65.5%. The mean age was 58.8 ± 16.8 (29-99) years. In most cases (60.3%), the tumors were located at the limbus. The most common clinical characteristic was papilliform appearance (46.2%). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was found in 37 (22.0%) patients with a mean age of 40.5 ± 7.7 years. The treatments and outcomes were evaluated in 136 eyes whose main initial treatment was wide excision with adjunctive cryotherapy (47.8%), followed by topical mitomycin C (30.9%). The mean follow-up time after treatment was 20.8 ± 2.2 (3-110) months and the recurrence occurred in 18 eyes (13.2%) during the follow-up period. The mean recurrence-free time (months) for CIN was significantly longer than that of SCC (81.3 ± 10.0 [95%CI 61.5 - 101.1] vs 33.2 ± 4.6 [95%CI 24.0 - 42.3], p = 0.030).

It covers information on visual health status, dietary habits through interviews, and professional ophthalmological examinations. Participants' CVH status was assessed using the LE8 algorithm, and relationships with major ocular diseases such as retinopathy, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were explored through weighted logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic splines, stratified analysis, and sensitivity analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, lower LE8 scores showed a significant positive relationship with any ocular disease (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.39-2.96, p=.001), any objectively determined ocular disease (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.48-3.38, p<.001), retinopathy (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.89-4.41, p<.001), DR (OR: 10.23, 95% CI: 3.11-33.61, p<.001), and glaucoma (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.47-5.21, p=.003), with all trends significant(all p<.01).

The crude incidence rates per 10,000 person-years were 35.06 for females and 29.15 for males. The incidence of cataracts increased in both males and females with factors such as Asian or Black ethnicity, smoking status, obesity, diabetes, and myopia. However, males who consumed alcohol or were unemployed suffered a greater risk of cataracts compared to their female counterparts, while high socioeconomic status, elevated blood pressure and metabolic syndrome were associated with a greater risk of cataracts in females than in males.\n",

      "Pediatric cataracts are one of the leading causes of treatable childhood blindness. Untreated cataracts can significantly impact the affected child, family, and society at large socially, economically, and emotionally. Pediatric cataracts remain a challenge in ophthalmological practice because of the need to identify, diagnose, and manage the condition as early as possible to prevent amblyopia. Routine screening and awareness among parents about leukocoria and strabismus lead to early diagnosis and management. A good preoperative evaluation, intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation, meticulous surgery, and equally efficient postoperative care and visual rehabilitation are important for a favorable outcome. An interdepartmental effort involving pediatrics, anesthesia, ophthalmology, and optometry helps properly and effectively manage pediatric cataracts. Pediatric cataracts are a major cause of preventable blindness worldwide, especially prevalent in developing countries where late diagnosis often results in symptoms such as nystagmus, poor fixation, and complete cataracts. Early intervention can significantly improve affected children's personal and social lives, enhancing their visual rehabilitation and positively impacting their family's socioeconomic status. Pediatric cataract contributes to 5% to 20% of childhood blindness and severe visual impairment globally, with an incidence rate between 1.8 and 3.6 per 10,000 children annually.

In people with lighter skin, it appears red or orange. But people with darker skin can have yellow, green or bluish tints in the reflection. Abnormal coloration can be a sign of eye conditions, some serious. A red reflex can be elicited with an ophthalmoscope and is normal with light projecting onto eyes symmetrically without opacities or spots. Leukocoria, a white reflex, is an abnormal finding and may indicate the presence of cataracts, a tumor, or retinopathy of prematurity. Cataracts can also cause reduced or absent red reflex.

      "This study investigated the description and feasibility of a surgical procedure for enucleation-exenteration of the equine eye via the supraorbital fossa. A preliminary study was performed on both eyes of four cadaveric heads of native breed donkeys () to describe the surgical anatomy and demonstrate a new supraorbital enucleation surgical approach. For the clinical study, eight donkeys were admitted for unilateral enucleation. All procedures were performed in a lateral recumbent position under the influence of inhalation anesthesia in combination with a retrobulbar nerve block. A semi-circular incision was made in the skin and fascia of the supraorbital fossa to gain access into the orbital cavity, after which the periorbital fat was dissected and removed. Bleeding was controlled by electrocautery and large blood vessels were ligated, then the eyeball was dissected sharply and freed from its bony attachment. The procedure was successfully accomplished in all clinical cases, and no significant complications occurred during or throughout the postoperative follow-up period. The initial results suggest the feasibility and safety of the supraorbital enucleation technique described in this study for equine eye enucleation. This new technique seems promising due to its feasibility, safety, and positive outcomes observed in both cadaveric and clinical studies.\n",

      "Subarachnoid injection during a retrobulbar block is a rare complication, requiring prompt recognition and management of life-threatening respiratory and cardiac depression. This case report describes a patient who began to decompensate 2 minutes after receiving a retrobulbar block. Central nervous system symptoms progressed from restlessness and confusion to respiratory arrest and cardiac depression. Intubation, ventilatory support, and treatment of mild bradycardia and hypotension were provided. One hour after the incident, the patient was fully awake and was extubated. Brain stem anesthesia was suspected. Causes of respiratory arrest and unconsciousness after retrobulbar block include severe anaphylactic reaction, intravascular absorption, a major cardiovascular event, and subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic. The patient's symptoms in the case presented here suggested that the local anesthetic gained access to the cerebrospinal fluid. Anesthetists should be cognizant of the need to monitor and treat serious complications whenever a retrobulbar block is utilized.\u001b[0m\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate formulas for intraocular lens (IOL) calculation in silicone oil (SO)-filled eyes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, consecutive case series.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted our study at the Department of Ophthalmology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany, and included SO-filled eyes that received SO removal combined with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. Preoperative assessments included biometry (IOLMaster 700; Carl Zeiss Meditec). To evaluate the measurements, we compared the mean prediction error, and mean and median absolute prediction error of 8 different formulas.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 90 eyes matched our inclusion criteria. The median absolute error was lowest in the Barrett Universal II formula (0.43 diopters [D] ± 0.75) followed by Kane (0.44 D ± 0.75), Hill-radial basis function (0.47 D ± 0.74), Holladay II (0.47 D ± 0.77), Sanders Retzlaff Kraff/theoretical (0.51 D ± 0.74), Holladay I (0.51 D ± 0.76), and Haigis and Hoffer Q (0.52 D ± 0.74 each). Regarding eyes within ±0.5 D Barrett Universal II (57.8%, 52 eyes) performed best, again followed by Kane (56.7%, 51 eyes) and Hill-radial basis function (54.4%, 49 eyes).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Using modern formulas for IOL calculation in oil-filled eyes improves predictability but still not as good as in unoperated eyes. This issue is created by the change in refractive index due to the SO fill and therefore a lower precision of axial length measurement and effective lens position prediction.\n",

      "DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study METHODS: The study included 224 eyes with PXF and 287 control eyes without PXF. One eye per patient, who underwent cataract surgery at the Wolfson Medical Center between January 2020 to December 2021, was included. Medical records of the patients were reviewed. Data collected included demographic characteristics, medical history, preoperative comprehensive ophthalmic examination, biometry, surgical procedure details, and IFIS occurrence. The association of IFIS with preoperative ocular parameters was analyzed through both univariant and multivariant analyses.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with PXF were older and had a higher prevalence of glaucoma (77.6 ± 6.4 years vs 74.2±7.6 years; p < 0.001, and 20.1 % vs 9.8 %, p < 0.001, respectively). Prevalence of α-blockers treatment was similar in both groups. IFIS rate among the PXF group was 12.5% (n = 28) compared to 7.3% (n = 21) in the control group (p < 0.05). When omitting patients exposed to α-blockers, the PXF group exhibited a significantly higher IFIS rate (9.9% vs 4.8%; p < 0.05). Pupil dilation diameter was significantly lower among PXF patients (5.8 ± 1.1 mm vs 6.9 ± 0.99 mm; p < 0.001). Biometric evaluation revealed significant differences in anterior segment depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT).

      "METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 55 patients with α-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α-ARA) treatment and 55 controls undergoing cataract surgery. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), video pupilometer, and biometry measurements were performed preoperatively and analyzed regarding anatomic parameters that corresponded with a higher rate of IFIS.

      "RESULTS: Pupil diameter was significantly smaller in patients who developed IFIS compared to those who did not develop IFIS (AS-OCT 3.29 ± 0.85 vs. 3.63 ± 0.68, p = 0.03; Pupilometer 3.56 ± 0,87 vs. 3.95 ± 0.67, p = 0.02). Biometric evaluation revealed shallower anterior chambers in the IFIS group (ACD 3.12 ± 0.40 vs. 3.32 ± 0.42, p = 0.02). Cutoff values for 50% IFIS probability (p = 0.5) were PD = 3.18 mm for pupil diameter and ACD = 2.93 mm for anterior chamber depth. ROC curves of combined parameters were calculated for α-ARA medication with pupil diameter and anterior chamber depth, which yielded an AUC of 0.75 for all IFIS grades.\n",

      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed 59 670 cases of patients operated for cataract in 2017-2021. To prevent infections, patients received four instillations of third generation fluoroquinolone (quinolone antibiotic) in the course of two days prior to cataract phacoemulsification (PE), and two instillations immediately (1 hour and 30 minutes) before the surgery; three-minutes treatment of the cornea, conjunctival sac and periocular skin with 5% povidone iodine before the surgery; and as the last step of surgery, patients received subconjunctival injection of 0.05 g cefazolin with 2 mg dexamethasone. Follow-up after surgery included four injections of 0.5% levofloxacin in the course of 7-10 days, and 0.1% dexamethasone for two weeks, or fixed combination of tobramycin and dexamethasone four times per day for two weeks. The criteria for acute endophthalmitis are: loss of spatial vision, absence of red reflex, pronounced thickening of the choroid, suspended particulates in the retrovitreal space and the vitreous observed with ultrasonography in the early postoperative period (day 4-7 after surgery).\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE: To study the clinical features, causative factors and treatment outcomes in patients with infectious scleritis seen in India.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective study of all patients examined at a tertiary care center between August 2012 and March 2021.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty-five patients (45 eyes; mean age 52.7 ± 17.5 years) were included in the study. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.1 ± 4.4 months. Inciting factors were found in 53.3% (injury: 33.3%; ocular surgery: 20.0%). The scleritis was predominantly anterior (97.8%), with multiple lesions in 40.0%, a solitary lesion in 31.1%, and diffuse in 28.9%. Associated features included uveitis (51.1%), keratitis (37.8%), hypopyon (15.6%), and endophthalmitis (6.7%). Causative organisms included bacteria (53.3%), fungi (35.6%), and presumed herpes virus (11.1%). All patients were treated with antimicrobial agents along with systemic corticosteroids where indicated. Surgical treatment included scleral debridement (37.8%), patch grafts (4.4%), and penetrating keratoplasty (2.2%). Complete resolution of scleritis was seen in 86.7%, with a mean duration of therapy of 2.9 ± 2.5 months. The mean follow-up was 8.3 ± 14.3 months. 51.1% of patients lost functional vision (<6/60). Causes of decreased vision included corneal scar, cataract, macular scar, glaucomatous optic atrophy, and phthisis bulbi. On bivariate analysis, poor visual acuity at presentation was associated with a worse visual outcome ( = 0.02). Other risk factors included necrotizing scleritis, multifocal scleritis, the presence of keratitis and uveitis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In our study, infectious scleritis resulted from bacterial and fungal infections. The scleritis resolved in most subjects, however, vision loss was frequent due to infection-related complications.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To provide a detailed review of the risk factors associated with endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify studies that reported on risk factors for endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.\n",
      "RESULTS: The review identified several risk factors for endophthalmitis, including diabetes, immunosuppression, previous ocular surgery, intraoperative complications such as posterior capsule rupture, and preoperative ocular surface disease such as blepharitis and conjunctivitis. The review also highlighted the importance of sterile technique and proper sterilization of surgical instruments and intraocular lenses.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To present a cause of posterior capsule aspiration and a technique using optimized parameters to prevent it from happening when operating soft cataracts.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective list of posterior capsule aspiration cases was kept over 4,062 consecutive cases operated with the Alcon CENTURION machine and Balanced Tip. Video analysis of one case of posterior capsule aspiration was accomplished. A surgical technique was developed using empirically derived machine parameters and customized setting-selection procedure step toolbar to reduce the pace of aspiration of soft nuclear quadrants in order to prevent capsule aspiration.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two cases out of 3,238 experienced posterior capsule aspiration before use of the soft quadrant technique. Video analysis showed an attractive vortex effect with capsule aspiration occurring in 1/5 of a second. A soft quadrant removal setting was empirically derived which had a slower pace and seemed more controlled with no capsule aspiration occurring in the subsequent 824 cases. The setting featured simultaneous linear control from zero to preset maximums for: aspiration flow, 20 mL/min; and vacuum, 400 mmHg, with the addition of torsional tip amplitude up to 20% after the fluidic maximums were achieved. A new setting selection procedure step toolbar was created to increase intraoperative flexibility by providing instantaneous shifting between the soft and normal settings.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: A technique incorporating a reduced pace for soft quadrant acquisition and aspiration can be accomplished through the use of a dedicated setting of integrated machine parameters.

      "Observation: \u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mRecognizing the symptoms of corneal edema after cataract surgery is crucial for early detection and treatment. Common symptoms include blurred or hazy vision, increased sensitivity to light, eye pain or discomfort, and halos around lights. It is important to differentiate between normal post-surgery discomfort and symptoms of corneal edema. A buildup of pressure inside your eye can cause the incision in your eye to open. This can put you at risk for an eye infection and lens dislocation. This will affect your vision, require many eye drops to heal, and you may need a repeat surgery. Infection: During cataract surgery, your ophthalmologist makes a small incision (cut) in your eye ...

Factors such as patient age, cataract grade, and mechanical stress were identified as contributors to endothelial cell loss. Furthermore, pachymetry and optical ... This incision needs to be closed with stitches to prevent any leakage of fluid from the eye and to maintain the structural integrity of the eye.

Cataract surgery is a common and effective procedure for treating cataracts, a condition that causes clouding of the lens in the eye, leading to blurry vision. During cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens to restore clear vision. However, in some cases, scar tissue can form in the eye after cataract surgery. During cataract surgery, a small incision is made to access the eye and the clouded lens of the eye (the cataract) is removed by ultrasound. It is then replaced with an artificial lens.
